Where is the Episode III--
It's right here.
It's on my webzone right now, redlettmedia.com.
Good.
I will watch it soon.
But now, where is the Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull--
It's right here.
What?
It's on my webzone right now, at redlettmedia.com.
What about The Last Airbender--
That's done, too.
It's right here.
It's on my webzone right now.
Bullshit.
You did not make all those reviews already.
Why don't you go there and find out, asshole.
Where is--
Right here.
What?
It's on my webzone right now, at redlettmedia.com.
I was not going to ask for a review on that.
I've foreseen it, though.
Only I can do that.
Look, would you just go away already.
I have prepared a 108-page response to your so-called Phantom Menace review.
Wait, what?
I shall now read it aloud.
Chapter 1, paragraph 1.
If you didn't like the Star Wars prequels, then you're stupid pants.
Please, stop.
You simply just don't understand the complexity of what happened in the film.
What?
I will refrain from explaining the complexity, because it is so complex and technical, that you do not need to understand it to enjoy the film.
Oh, god.
Stop it.
It is like a very deep game of chess, where both players don't know how to play chess.
You just don't get it, do you?
No, I'm afraid it is you who don't get it.
Your opinion is wrong, and mine is right.
Please, just let it end.
What?
