JACK:
Okay.
So what are we doing here?
We got a jib?

MIKE:
Yes.

JACK:
Okay.

MIKE:
And let's test it out.

JACK:
Okay.
Testing out the jib.

JAY:
Maybe turn it on here.

MIKE:
This tends to lean a bit.

JAY:
Oh, right.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
You just want me hit "record"?

MIKE:
No, no, no.
Just turn it on.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's a little bit, it's straight.

JACK:
There's the shot.

MIKE:
Somewhere around there?

JAY:
That looks good.

JACK:
Tell me, tell me about what we're, what we're gonna shoot here right now.

JOCELYN:
Uh, we're doing a teaser trailer-type thing.
Isn't that right?

JAY:
Yes.

JOCELYN:
Uh, for Revenge of the Sith review.

JACK:
Ah.

JOCELYN:
With Mr. Plinkett.

JACK:
Do you, how often do you get stopped on the street, uh, for, for, being, uh, the, the hooker in the Plinkett reviews?

JOCELYN:
You know what?
I don't ever.
But it was kind of funny because when I was buying this costume...

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

JOCELYN:
I was getting, like, the little, uh, body suit thing. It's a, it's a one-piece, you know?

JACK:
Okay.

JOCELYN:
And, um, it was at Halloween Express...

JACK:
Oh.

JOCELYN:
In Greendale.

JACK:
Oh.

JOCELYN:
And the nice thing about it is the lady, she had really, cute young girl with, like, red hair, and she's, like:
"Can I show you around?"
Because it was, like, this huge warehouse of tons of wigs and anything you could ever want for Halloweeen.
And I was like:
"Yeah, I just need a body suit."
So she took me around and showed me a whole bunch of stuff.
I tried on the stuff.
She's like:
"Yeah, that works for you."
"It looks good."
And then, she's like:
"What is, are you doing a film tomorrow?"
"What is that for?"
And I was like:
"Well, have you ever seen, you know, the Star Wars videos on YouTube, the review?"
And she's like:
"Yeah!"
And I'm like:
"I'm the girl in the basement."
And she's like:
"Shut the fuck up."

JAY:
Oh, really?

JOCELYN:
She thought it was really cool.

JAY:
Oh, nice.

JOCELYN:
Yeah, so the girl who sold me the body suit for the costume is, uh...

JAY:
Is a Plinkett fan?

JOCELYN:
She's a fan, yes.

JAY:
Oh, that's exciting.

JOCELYN:
So I thought that was kind of cool.

JACK:
Oh...
Oh...

JAY:
This is our hi-tech lighting rig.

JACK:
It looks like a tiny light on top of a tiny camera.

JAY:
I know what it looks like.

JACK:
I'm just letting you know.
That's powerful.

JAY:
Yeah.

JACK:
That's...

JAY:
Yeah, this, this little light's amazing.

JACK:
Yeah.
That's, actually...

JOCELYN:
It's pretty badass, isn't it?

JACK:
Really frightening.
Um, how did you get into character?
To, to stand there?

JAY:
"To stand there."

JOCELYN:
Um, well, I did put on my lipstick.

JACK:
Uh-huh.
Looks good.

JOCELYN:
And, um, that only helps me because my face is not in the shot.

JAY:
Not in this shot.

JOCELYN:
So that really, really makes a difference for, for how I, how I got myself into the moment for this character, for this moment.

MIKE:
Wind test.

JAY:
Nice.

JACK:
Okay.
Another wind test.
You guys can't see that.
It's Mike flapping a cardboard piece of box.
Well, that looks great!

JAY:
Why do big Hollywood films waste so much money on those giant, like, fans?

MIKE:
All they need is this.

JAY:
All you need is a piece of cardboard.
Hollywood is fucked up.
