Hey, everyone.
This Saturday October 6 the Milwaukee Film Festival presents three goals talk about web videos.
Yeah.
That's actually the name of it.
It's a panel hosted by Jay Bauman, Mike Stoklasa, and Jack Packard.
Jack is from a site called Funny or Die.
He made internet hits such as the High Five videos, Hey Pass Me a Beer, and...Cock Gun.
He's also the co-creator and the guy inside the Fuck Bot costume.
Also in attendance will be actress Jocelyn Ridgely, and Internet legend rich Evans in his first public appearance ever.
And I mean ever, cuz he never leaves his house.
So come out to this pointless event.
Ask Jay and Mike questions like, when is the next Plinkett review, and when is the next Plinkett review?
The event starts at 7 p.m.
at Y-Not III Tavern 1854 East Kenilworth Place, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
If you're nowhere near Milwaukee, please post a comment below telling us that, then we could move the event closer to you.
We'll be hanging out after the Q&A, so it's the perfect time for you to buy Rich Evans a beer.
He likes these brands.
He also loves to do shots.
I approve of these things.
Wait a minute, what?
Aren't you supposed to complain?
I approve of these things because, like you, I have also sold out.
Hey, they aren't getting paid for this.
Plus, it's free.
When is the next get review?
Remember, this is a free event, so you don't have to wait in line like these people to pay for tickets.
