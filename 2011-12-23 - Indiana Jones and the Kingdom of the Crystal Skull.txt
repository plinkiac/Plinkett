PLINKETT:
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the fourth film in the Indiana Jones film series.
It stars Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, and Shia LaBeouf.

MUTT:
Get on, gramps!

PLINKETT:
It had some fun moments, but overall it was pretty disappointing.
That's the end.

"No one cares about Half in the Bag!"
Oh.
But I just did the Indiana Jones review.
Oh, wait.
I guess you wanted something a little more in-depth, right?
Okay.
Let's start this over.
Here goes nothing!
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the most disappointing thing since...well, The Phantom Menace.
I can't recall the last time when such a beloved pairing created such an embarrassing turd.
At least not since Chaz Bono.
The only saving grace here is that this is just some crappy Indiana Jones adventure.Lord knows there have been a lot of those already.
So it's not like it ruined some very important backstory, like another series of films did.
But, like the prequels, the choices made here are just baffling.
Did you two guys forget to take your brain medicine?
You know, the medicine that doesn't make you do crazy things?
Because if you needed to bororw some, I've got a lot of it.
Number 1. Uncovering a Mystery.
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a movie nobody wanted to make

SPIELBERG:
I'm done with the series!
It was great!
Let's walk away!

PLINKETT:
It was also a movie that everybody wanted to see...until they did.
And in the end, though, everybody lost.
Except for Karen Allen, who got to take a break from her job in a tollbooth to once again star in a feature film.
I guess whoever got paid to work on the movie won a little, too, because they got paid.
But the audience had to suffer through another sad chapter from the What Could Have Been Great book that's currently being written by George Lucas.

LUCAS:
Indiana Jones and the Attack of the Giant Ants.

PLINKETT:
The difference this time is that certain elements seem to have been in place to prevent another disaster.
We have a competent director named Steven Spielberg, who has continued to make...mostly good movies.
A fine director of photography named Janusz Kam-, Kam-...
Can we edit that out?
Harrison Ford is back in the starring role.
A screenwriter that's not George Lucas.
And most importantly, George Lucas isn't the screenwriter.
And he wasn't directing it, either.
he was just helping out with the story and throwing out ideas like he did before.
So what the fuck happened?

SPIELBERG:
That was George's idea.
George said,
"You know, I'd love to introduce Harrison this time playing Indy in the trunk of a car."
And I said,
"That's fine by me!"

PLINKETT:
But, you see, like Indiana Jones, I'm an archaeologist of sorts.
And, no.
I'm not talking about finding bones in my basement.
Because I know how those got there.
But I'm going to look into this mystery to the best of my ability so we could try to solve it.
I will put my finger deep into this analysis, and try to scoop out the truth that I know is inside that dark cave.
Oh, my god!
Look out!
It's a giant turd!
Let's continue.
Let's start by renaming this film.
We'll call it Indiana Jones and the Policy of No Refunds.
No.
That doesn't make a lot of sense.
How about Indiana Jones and the Mystery of Why This Movie Didn't Work?
Because it's hard to point your finger at one specific detail.
Oh, my god!
Okay.
I guess that could be it.
But it's more of a blur of bad.
So I'm no stranger to the Indiana Jones films.
In fact, next to Star Wars, Star Trek, and the Olsen Twins movies, it's my favorite series of films to masturbate to.
Oh.
I didn't mean to say that out loud.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh!
Oh!
I'm gonna cum!
I'm gonna cum!
Oh!
Ohhh, my god!
My TV!
Oh, no!
Oh!
I blasted a hole in my TV screen.
Oh, fuck!
Aughhh!
Oh!
I can't stop coming!
Aughhh!
You see, I have every image, every sound, every dialogue practically burned into my brain.
The Indiana Jones films aren't exactly works of art, though.
And they're not really meant to be.
They're well-made, tongue-in-cheek, action adventure films that once again pay homage to the old serials of the past that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg enjoyed watching as kids.
It's those things that inspired to make movies of their own.
You see, these films are less about the characters and realism and more about the spectacle and the adventure.
So when the time came to actually make another one of these films, well, what exactly could the thought process have been?
I guess they should've started with "we better not".
But since they didn't, let's do what I do best.
Ejaculate blood into a storm drain.
Wait.
What?
Number 2. What's This Next Film That No One Wants to Make Going to Be About Anyways?
When deciding to do a fourth Indiana Jones movie, these are the questions that probably came up.
Number 1. When do we set it?
Well, Harrison is 65-years old, so probably some time in the late 1950's.
Number 2. Who are the bad guys?
Since the Nazis are gone, the Russians seem like a good choice.
It was the height of the Cold War, so that makes sense:

INDY:
Russians.

PLINKETT:
Number 3. We need another character gimmick right?
People liked when Sean Connery was in the other one.
But he's too old now.
And we did that already.
Having Indy's son seems to make sense.
How about a greaser?
Someone that would conflict with him a little, like the dad did?

LUCAS:
At the beginning, it was a daughter he didn't know about.
And, uh, I thought that'd be a great thing.
Steve, actually, didn't like that idea.

PLINKETT:
And, lastly, what's the story about?
Well, that was the first misstep.
Aliens and Indiana Jones is weird and strange.
Could've been good if it was done right, but I dunno.

SPIELBERG:
George Lucas had this idea for Indiana Jones.
And it was bsasically,
"Hey, let's do aliens."

PLINKETT:
Hey, what about Sputnik?
Didn't that happen in 1957?
Something Soviet with the Russians.

SPIELBERG:
So George insisted, and he didn't...
He said,
"This'll be like a B-movie."
"It'll be like those 1950's B-movies with flying saucers..."

PLINKETT:
Um...
Think Indy could go to Russia?
The Ukraine?
Siberia, or whatever?
There's a lot of history there, and probably some kind of cool archaeological stuff.

LUCAS:
It was the idea of taking the genre...

PLINKETT:
Um...

LUCAS:
From the 1930's serials, action adventure serials...

PLINKETT:
Stop talking.

LUCAS:
To the B science fiction movies of the 50's.
The early 50's.

PLINKETT:
Or maybe the Russians with some kind of superweapon, and Indiana Jones is called out of retirement to help stop them.

SPIELBERG:
Okay.
These are inter-dimensional beings.
They're not extraterrestrials.
They're inter-dimensional.
So I said,
"Fine."
"Fine."

PLINKETT:
But we went with aliens because that's what George wanted.
Why is he so important?
Since when does being a billionaire that owns the company making the movie mean you have some kind of say in it?

LUCAS:
It's been a kind of long road to get everybody to agree.
And we're not gonna do the movie unless all three of us agree on it.

PLINKETT:
Anyways.
You see, Indiana Jones and the Saucer Men from Mars was actually George Lucas's original idea in the mid-90's.
It had Indiana Jones running around with a live alien named Gubu.
And it also dealt with Indiana Jones getting married, too.
A lot of these ideas were eventually shoved into this movie, along with tons of other retarded shit.
Which is why this movie feels like a hodgepodge of crap from all over the place, and not a singular, solid idea.
What were these people smoking?
Cigarettes?
Number 3. The Indiana Jones Structure.
The Indiana Jones films have worked on a basic principle of repetition.
LIke the verse/chorus/verse structure of a pop song, and like other successful film series, they succeed with the "same but different" approach.
Most people complain that sequels are just the original film done over again.
Just a little different, maybe.
Different location.
Maybe different characters.
But essentially the same story or idea.
The James Bond franchise has gotten away with this 21 times.
There will always be an exception to the rule, of course.
But the "same but different" theory will usually apply.
People don't like things that are different.
And they want the same shit that they got last time.
Anybody want a pizza roll?
Email me if you want a pizza roll.
Post a comment on my webzone if you would like me to send you a pizza roll in the mail.
People like sameness, predictability, and they don't like to take chances or try new things.
That's why we have Applebee's!
Oh, god.
Thinking about Applebee's just made me throw up in my own stomach.
However, with this film, given the vast amount of time that had passed, I think some kind of risk might've been justified.
And I ain't talking about puttin in a UFO!
The original formula just didn't work here for many reasons.
Risk is why I love the Temple of Doom so much.
It's because it's unapologetic for what it is.
And it took a lot of chances.
Willie Scott was there for comic relief, and the kid was there for kid appeal, I suppose.
But at its core, the movie was really dark.

LUCAS:
We decided to go darker.
Uh, part of that, I guess, I was going through a divorce at the time.
And I wasn't in a good mood.

PLINKETT:
It had devil worshippers, child slave labor, guy getting killed by a flaming shishkabob, human sacrifice with a heart being ripped out, and so on.
Now you can argue whether or not this was the best or the worst film in the series, but at least they took a big risk.
The Last Crusade was a good time to play it safe.
This is not.
So what do I mean by all this?
Well, the first three films were inspired by those old adventure serials, right?
Traveling.
Shooting.
Adventure.
Discovery.
Exotic foreign lands and romance.
Weird cultures, etc.
But then they say that all this is a homage to the 1950's scifi B-movies.

LUCAS:
And I wanted to wrest it on a cinematic...

PLINKETT:
Hey, did I give you permission to talk?
This movie has nothing to do with those old sci-fi movies.
It's just the same adventure serial crap from the first three movies with an alien thing in it.
If it was a 50's sci-fi B-movie, Indiana Jones would spend most of his time in a laboratory talking to government scientists about...things.
And then at the end, something might land in the city.
Or there'd be, like, a ray gun, or a weird robot thing would try to take over the world.
I dunno.
What I'm saying is, something radically different was needed with this fourth movie.
There are other kinds of adventure and action in movies, you know?
But that would've been a really big risk to not have Indy do the same schtick in the same formula.
Indiana Jones is too iconic for his own good.
Anyhoo.
Let's recap the basic elements from the Indiana Jones films, so you know where I'm coming from.
I assume you've seen the films if you're watching this review.
If not, you should get your fucking head checked.
Number 1. Indiana Jones Character Introduction.
Let's start with Indy.
Indy always gets a cool introduction to the movies.
The coolest reveal is, of course, in Raiders.
Ohhh...snap!
In Temple of Doom, he's, like, cool and suave and wearing a white tuxedo.

INDY:
Thank you.

PLINKETT:
It's cool because Indy see in an environment we haven't seen him in before.
The third film has a cool reveal, too, I guess, because there's a neat transition from youth to adulthood.
Even though it starts with him getting punched in the face.
Number 2. Stock Characters.
Next, Indy formula dictates that we need a main villain, a secondary villain, and the muscle.
We had Belloq and Major Toht, Mola Ram and Chattar Lal, and Donovan and Elsa Schneider.
The muscle charaters are there to have an elongated fight sequence with Indiana Jones for the purposes of action and/or adventure.
Number 1 was the big guy by the plane who gets fucking killed in the propeller blades.
Number 2 was the bearded turban man who gets fucking crushed by a rock crusher.
And number 3 was General Vogel in the tank who gets fucking crushed when he falls off a cliff.
Number 3. Female Lead.
The first fillm has Marion Ravenwood.
The second film has Willie Scott.
And the third is Dr. Elsa Schneider.
And while most of you will argue that Willie Scott was irritating as fuck...at least she was different.
In fact, each character was unique and memorable.
Number 4. General Plot Shit.
Each Indy film begins with an opening that generally has nothing to do with the main plot.
It's just to establish Indiana Jones and to set the tone.
The golden idol had nothing to do with the Lost Ark.
The cremated remains of Nurhachi had nothing to do with the glowing rocks whatever from The Temple of Doom.
In The Last Crusade, the Cross of Coronado had nothing to do with the Holy Grail.
Well, other than the obvious religious symbolism.
But remember, I'm talking about the main plot.
Typically, then, everything follows the basic structure of an average screenplay.
After the opening action sequence, Indiana Jones gets the information about what he's gonna go after.

INDY:
The city of Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.

SHAMAN:
So you will go to Pankot Palace.

VOGEL:
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

PLINKETT:
He travels somewhere, gathers more clues and information, and there's an action scene or two which are interspersed with some new information and twists.
Eventually, Indiana Jones is put in the worst possible position where everything is lost.
He's trapped in a snake pit, he's a slave to Mola Ram, and his dad in his trapped in the tank.
Everybody is fucked.
Eventually, Indy fights back, and he's pushed to his physical limitations.
He manages to eventually overcome the bad guys, and there is some resolution to the plot.
Remember those?
And I ain't talking about the one I put my wife in!
Number 4. Cracks in the Crystal Skull.
Now, onto the excrement.
The problem with all this is that the Crystal Skull does seem to follow this pattern enough.
You got an opening action sequence, the muscle, love interest, plot introduction, travel, discovery interspersed with action sequences, low point, final fight, and resolution.
So what went so fucking horribly wrong?

LUCAS:
Under budget!

PLINKETT:
Well, the details, for starters.
And all the ideas, too.
Mostly coming from, you know, that guy.
The one that wanted the third film to take place in a haunted house.
The original story for the third film was a haunted castle movie.
But Steven had just finished Poltergeist, so he said,
"I don't wanna do another haunted castle."
So I said,
"Okay."

PLINKETT:
What?
Thankfully, we had Steven Spielberg to not let that shit happen.
And they appeared to compromise.

SEAN CONNERY:
And anyway, at first it didn't bode too well, because I think George had a different idea -- Lucas -- of what it was about.

PLINKETT:
Or at least he seemed more willing to tell George Lucas that his ideas were terrible.

LUCAS:
I'm gonna take the haunted castle, and put it in the beginning for the teaser.

PLINKETT:
But this time, I'm not sure what happened.
Spielberg either lost his ability or willingness to shut the crap down, or he just didn't care.
But regardless of whatever the pre-production process was, Crystal Skull feels like a movie directed by 5 different people, and the ideas of 27 other people all shoved into one movie.
So let's try to make some sense of the st ructure.
Crystal Skull, unlike the other films, opens with a sequence directly tied to the main plot of the movie.
Even though, I guess, finding this alien in the box had little to do with the crystal skull since it was a different alien.
Or did it have a crystal skull, too?
I thought it was the one from the Roswell crash?
But those were little short aliens.
These other ones were nine feet tall.
It doesn't look like it's the same one.
What?
Did it have a crystal skull or didn't it?
But the crystal skull was from the one alien with the thirteen skeletons, right?
Who is this?
Which is actually one alien.
Are there two types of aliens?
What?
Little Roswell ones and the tall ones?
Or was there just one alien?

SPALKO:
A distant cousin, perhaps.
Maybe they, too, were sent to find Atakur.

PLINKETT:
Oh, wait.
She just said something about "distant cousins".
Oh...
