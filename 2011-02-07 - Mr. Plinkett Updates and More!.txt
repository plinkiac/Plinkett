PLINKETT:
Hey, everybody. I'm selling out! In fact, I'm selling out while I'm jumping the shark. Check out my webzone for a link to The Great Plinkett Auction on ebay. You can bid on all of my personal treasured items like: my Titanic popcorn tub, my goddamn phone, my stupid grandkids's Star Wars toys, and some of the actual scripts that I used to make my reveiws from. Even props from the fucking flop movie Feeding Frenzy. Why am I selling all my shit? Well, I just got back from my doctor. He said, normally, they can normally operate on a brain tumor, but this one is malignant. So I've only got a little...

LAWYER:
Mr. Plinkett?

PLINKETT:
What?

LAWYER:
It's Saul, your lawyer.

PLINKETT:
Oh, uh-huh..

LAWYER:
Listen, we need to discuss a better way to talk about the situation.

PLINKETT:
Sorry, that was my lawyer. There's no problem at all. Please continue to buy my products and visit my webzone. Speaking of webzones and products, there's a new Plinkett e-store, with lots of new merchandise, like my new Jump the Shark t-shirt. We've got mugs, baby bibs, t-shirts, hats, and so much more! Act now!
Operators are standing by.

PALPATINE:
Would you quit selling out? You make me sick!

PLINKETT:
Hey, don't tell me not to sell out! Look at you, with all that bling on, you fucking old leathery-skinned asshole!

PALPATINE:
You sold out more than George Lucas did! You shark-jumping sellout!

PLINKETT:
Hey, shouldn't you be dead by now? You're so old!

PALPATINE:
What do you mean, I'm old? We're the same age! We went to the same high school!

PLINKETT:
Anyway, I mean, at some point, you will just die of natural causes, right? I'm getting a tired of you constantly interrupting me. Oh. Um...
