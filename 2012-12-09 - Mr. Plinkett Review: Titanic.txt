PLINKETT:
James Cameron's Titanic is a movie that's both one of the best movies ever made, or maybe the worst. "How can it be both?" you ask. Well, how can Lindsay Lohan be both revolting and fuckable? How did Neil Armstrong land on the moon, but never fuck Lindsay Lohan? Well, let's examine this film and why some people hate her and why some people love it right
there's gotta be some kind of explanation
was not the way of it
is it a good movie or is it a terrible movie
Well, everything is a matter of opinion I guess unless it's my opinion and then it's right
so let's jump in shall we
ha ha ha
number one I'm the king of the world
after winning the Oscar for Titanic James Cameron famously proclaimed on the Keith Moon
that's upset a lot of people because they saw it as a clear endorsement for return to monarchies
but anyway
you know the truth is that James Cameron kind of was the king of the world at the time 
in the ranking and a whole bunch of money sense
I mean the man made like a billion dollars or whatever with his movie about people drowning and freezing to death
it captured the imagination of the whole world
he also made a series of previously successful films like Terminator Terminator 2 aliens the abyss Free Willy and True Lies
but Titanic changed everything
it was a real game changer
unlike the self-proclaimed game changer avatar which didn't change any game
the only thing had changed was my diapers
because I was sitting too long watching it it was a very long movie and my diapers became uncomfortable to wear
it wasn't because I crapped myself why would you think that 
although later I did crap myself 
but that was because I ate Applebee's 
but avatar did I sure in a new age of 3d movies 
and by age I mean six months 
before Cameron was just a thinking man's Michael Bay 
now he's an artist making important movies with social commentary 
like Avatar avatar 2 avatar 3 and avatar 4 
all movies about how rich white Canadian people are greedy and bad 
and how blue elfs are so great because they live in a big tree and poop in the woods 
I poop in the woods 
what's the big fucking deal 
but i do love the Navi still 
in fact I captured my own Navi 

NA'VI:
Please, mister. I'm not a real Na'vi. I was just on my way to a Halloween party.

PLINKETT:
What? You're not making any goddamn sense. You must be getting lightheaded from all this oxygen.

NA'VI:
What?
i got this for you
let me turn it on
it's gas
it's what you used to breathe on pandora

NA'VI:
No! No, god, no! Please, please! No, no!

PLINKETT:
It'll help you breathe better!
So my question is was Titanic always the movie it was supposed to be 
James Cameron did say he pitched it as Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic 
or was it more like Star Wars a hack sci-fi flop that was saved in editing 

OBI-WAN KENOBI:
Only a master of evil, Darth.

PLINKETT:
both Mobe certainly were enhanced by their amazing scores to say the least
but for this review I'm gonna examine the good the bad and the ugly about Titanic which is ironically one of my favorite movies of all time 
sadly though I will not be reviewing TITanic 2000 one of my other favorite movies of all time 
number 2. the history
and I'm not talking about this ship 
although apparently most of today's retarded teenagers didn't even know the Titanic was a real event 
I know this movie is a little historically inaccurate though because I was actually on the Titanic 
I'm the last fucking survivor 
but I'll get more into that later 
anyways the Titanic is a movie about a pampered rich girl who tries to kill herself but survives both physically and emotionally 
only with the help of a man 
Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose McGowan played Jack and Kate two star-crossed lovers sailing on the ship of doom 
they get drunk fuck in someone else's car and yell at some poor guy just trying to do his job 

JACK DAWSON:
Shut up!

PLINKETT:
they also cause lots of property damage and generally act like fucking assholes 
Leo plays a guy named Jack Dawson a struggling actor who also draws pictures 

ROSE DEWITT BUKATER:
Well, well, well...and these were drawn from life?

PLINKETT:
Rose plays Kate Winslet a 17 year old girl being forced into marriage for money diamonds and domestic violence 
it's a classic love story really a girl being forced to marry some jerk with money and a bad Hollywood hairpiece 
I'd say the inspiration for Kate must have been Mia Farrow 
sinatra, you fuck!

FRANK SINATRA:
Oh, I hate this song. Hey, you sing it for eight years, you would hate it, too!

PLINKETT:
You bought your rug at Gillman's Discount Wigs in Jersey, you cheapskate. I know it because I sold it to you!

FRANK SINATRA:
Don't give me that jazz!

PLINKETT:
But anyhoo, she ends up falling in love with the poor struggling actor and decides to follow her heart or whatever 
Now see, first and foremost I think this is what a lot of people connected: with the simplicity of the story
Again it's kind of like Star Wars 
mainstream sci-fi in the 60's and 70's was pretty heavy and boring stuff for the most part 
and then came along the simple adventure film bought a boy who topples a giant space Empire with the help of his weird LGBT friends 
and bam you've got a pop cultural milestone 
it was the same thing with Titanic 
every so often you gotta stop and say hey everyone remember a good old-fashioned simple story you know one the general public can connect with 
that's why Lars von Trier's Antichrist was so popular 
so why do so many people hate Titanic 
is it because of that which Celine Dion and her fucking annoying song 

CELINE DION:
Is my boat ready?

PLINKETT:
is it because it became too popular and then it became cool to not like it anymore because it was so popular 
is Titanic what gave birth to the hipster movement 
or is it because James Cameron is a huge asshole 

JAMES CAMERON:
Otherwise, it's more work for Rob, even though I don't care.

PLINKETT:
Well, we'll discuss all these reasons but first: Number 3. Why Is This Movie Good? 
As I just said Titanic had a very basic love story lacking in any modern-day cynicism 
it was very old Hollywood as they say 
it's that return to a simpler time which will always have a universal appeal
but in addition to the heart string pulling story Titanic also gave us a great movie-going experience, complete with shooting guns and people dying a horrific ways
that's what I liked about the film, because I'm a history buff and a fan of violence
all kinds of violence
no previous Titanic film was filled with such amazing things
it was a new take on a classic story
these people weren't all singing nearer my God to these the ship went down

PASSENGERS:
Nearer my God to thee...

PLINKETT:
they were murdering each other
so you have these two main elements a simple and ultimately tragic love story even Mongoloids could relate to and a downright suspenseful and well-made action movie by one of the all-time action movie masters
but in addition to that there is attention to detail in another area
Number 4. Titanic History.
Titanic brings a historical event to life in an exciting way 
not the Jack and Kate Bart but mostly everything else 
we've heard most of this shit before but I'll go through it again 
when Titanic was built she was the largest moving object ever created by man...other than President Taft
Taft, you fuck! You bought your clothes at The Portly Gentleman used clothing store, you cheapskate! I know it because I sold it to you!
Anyways, I'm not just being sexist about Titanic 
it's because men fucking built it 
the only thing women did back then was complain
and also give birth to men who built amazing things a
anyway we had got a little arrogant and didn't think a horrible tragedy like this awesome ship sinking would ever happen
especially right after we just fucking built it 
the Titanic was also a micro microcosm of society at the time 
the first-class passengers on Titanic were rich white people 
second-class passengers were sort of rich white people 
and the third-class passengers were white people that were still better off than most black people 
then everyone had to struggle to survive when the rich white people from the White Star Line didn't put enough lifeboats on for all the white people 
then everyone turned even whiter when they died 
and you thought being black was hard 
some people on Titanic would die with nobility like Guggenheim Astor and Strauss 
And some people would act like fucking assholes
I'm looking at you Bruce Ismay
you fucked my mother
right before you got into the lifeboat with honor and nobility
Titanic was like a snow globe of instant drama 
just shake it up
Hmm, that reminds me
I've got a Titanic snow globe of my own
Let me go see where that's at
here's my titanic snow globe 
isn't it big
let me go have the Na'vi take a picture with it
and I'll send it to James Cameron who'll get a kick out of it 
Ehh!
Hey Na'vi, look at my titanic snow globe!
Isn't it great?
Hello?
Oh, fuck!
You Na'vi, you made me drop my Titanic snow globe, you fucking retarded elf! Fucking god, goddammit! I spent $100 on that crap!
Anyway back To Catch a Yeti
I love this movie
my point is Titanic is pretty hard to fuck up from a storytelling perspective
although the attempt at is sequel by the venerable asylum film company failed to live up to the same success as James Cameron's film most previous films about Titanic have done pretty good
and had a lot more swearing, too

CAPTAIN:
This boat is full, now get back!

THIRD-CLASS PASSENGER:
Fuck that!

FIRST-CLASS PASSENGER:
Well, three months later, he's fucking rich.

PLINKETT:
This film Titanic from 1953, there's A Night to Remember, and even two mini-series
One from 1996 and another one from this year
the 100th anniversary brought out a whole bunch of new Titanic crap that no one saw
how many times can the story be told
and why are people so fascinated by it
but even in 1995 with so many previous incarnations James Cameron went ahead to make his film 
and it's a good thing too because no one had done the story on this scale before 
other Titanic movies always had their limitations: cheap-looking miniatures, sets that kind of looked like what the ship looked like, just not at all
But Cameron set out to do something a little more epic: using non-union Mexican slave labor he built an ear size replica of the ship than a new studio Fox made for the movie I was in Baja Mexico great care was taken at every step during the process by the documentary crews not to show the Mexicans hand-carving the deckchairs for a dollar a day oh shit can we cut that out can you take that out Cameron also used his years of experience in making science fiction films to create some amazing effects for a story that wasn't traditionally thought of needing state-of-the-art special effects I even went down to the actual Titanic rack and film there to also cameras love of history inspired him to have real sets and costumes that were as accurate as possible I could sit back and say that Titanic was gay or that sock was retarded ass never been Wisconsin but you know you've got to respect the amount of work that this guy put into his movie I worked as a song unlike other filmmakers making similar films at the time and complaining about it we're never gonna be nobody family has a real hands-on director as stated in these propaganda films I've never seen anyone so out of the focus he's very talented in a lot of different areas technically as a director and as an artist as well. I also really cares about what he's trying to accomplish but then again so did Jim Jones / Cameron had much better results 11 less people died from cyanide poisoning number 5 sink this for I think Titanic was supposed to be an action movie suddenly I felt myself turning into an action hero great until that's Celine Dion song ruined everything and makes sense really James Cameron wrote and directed action movies I also has a passion for the sea and has always been fascinated with the Titanic if you were on the ship it was a rocket sled of a ride it was a roller coaster so I think his plan was to make an action movie with the love story in it rather than the opposite Pamela's a smart guy and he knows that in order to fully satisfy an audience they need an emotional core to the movie it became apparent to me that in order to satisfy all my dramatic goals it was going to have to be a love story let's take a look at some presidents who got Sarah and Kyle Virgil and Lindsay Harry and Helen Jake and Smurfette and so on  however when you think of the phrase love story movies like the Terminator ofthe abyss don't usually come to mind but we're Titanic it does in fact it's number 37 on afi's top 100 love story movies of all time so let's flash back to the original marketing campaign of Titanic when it was set to be released in the summer of 97 as previously seen like Titanic pop weren't Tubb the advertisements where all the Titanic logo sinking against the riveted steel of the ship my god later the artwork would mysteriously turn into this crap the original tag line was collide with destiny and then it suddenly became nothing on earth could come between them but something did come between them and I spurred and this whole thing always they mean on earth on icebergs in the water oh I get it then we all got inundated with this fictional Jack and Kate story crap and we forgot about the other 1,500 people that died especially that baby their baby is fucked lady and everything about this damn movie became about these two even fucking horrible fan art this one don't even make no goddamn sense people cried kids cried little girls cried babies cried and because of Titanic Leo got to fuck all these women Kate's heart will go on but Leo's hard-on will go on so none of Cameron's previous films were even mild attempts at making the greatest love story ever told or rather action films with some human elements to hold them together so what would make him want to be romantic all of a sudden Rockets were brought to the bridge by quartermaster ro who saw Boat seven in the water so having about seventy I guess five marriages makes them a pretty romantic guy right so how that work talks doing analysis and for going on the assumption that you want to make an action film from Titanic primarily Well, where do you start How can you squeeze every bit of action out of this historical event let me ask the Navi what she thinks about that hey not me I got a question for oh I guess she wasn't a Navi come to think of it she wasn't nine feet tall either and it looks like cheap Halloween makeup on her face and it looks like her wig fell off too also she kept saying that her name was Samantha or something and whatever back to my movie oh boy do I love to cut Yeti  on iceberg to hit sequence this is a given of course but it's probably thebest sequence in the whole film it's intense exciting and perfectly edited and executed he almost feel like the ship just might make it past the iceberg then you feel like an idiot for thinking that even our main characters are there to almost get hit by ice involving them in the action you see the chain of events that unfolded in the real history of the ship or so they say to the impact site this is where the initial intense stuff would have happened let's scrape decided the ship up as some guys get blasted by water and assumingly drowned or got burned by steam and his face guys getting trapped behind the watertight doors are closing in this action sequence red lights flashing in an industrial looking environment which is very James Cameron as seen in all these accompanying images from his previous films smoky metallic industrial mazes is something Cameron gets a hard-on from number three action down below the ship is slowly filling up with water let's get our heroes down into this ship to squeeze some action out of that situation rather than keep them up on the boat deck is mostly all the other Titanic films have done none of them really had the lead characters adventuring down below on the ship it was more about the human drama above next let's add sparks lots of sparking chaos breaking things breaking doors punch a guy in the face punch this guy in the face punch that guy in the face why not we'll have Jack handcuffed to a pipe and a desperate water rising situation okay we'll have to rescue him with an axe I bought a sudden rush of water and slow motion what sparks will drown a kid to one let's get trapped again some tense scenario with the key and almost drowning like in the abares water it's fucking scary some more sparks tumble drying off but we're not done there's still more jumping leaping climbing punching slapping pushing shooting people falling down getting hurt murder-suicide and one more punch in the face for good measure we haven't even gotten to the ship yet long before the ship to captain dies on the bridge when the water comes crashing in cables snapped from the funnels hitting people right in the fucking face but one of them lands on poor Fabrizio Mamamia I got the cross stuff a guy got electrocuted ship explodes and cracks in half people fall into sparks hundreds of people get smashed by the stunned section and the water guy breaks his legs on the propeller blades and some lady slides to her death revealing her unwashed pantaloons of which she had soiled but wait there's more don't forget all the action when the ship is sinking to crashing and smashing and falling and breaking or the selling all this shit have to do with the greatest love story ever told oh heavens I don't think one could squeeze any more action into this movie realistically I thought having it turn into some can't be schlock now most of you will argue that this is how most of this shit really went down unintended but Cameron continued to put his action stamp on Titanic most notably in this scene that was cut from the final film I may or may not remember that the young Lovejoy had a bleeding gash on his head I was like how did he get that teri bumpers had on something now I probably had an elongated fight sequence that was cut from the film turns out I was right Lovejoy goes after Jack and Kate in the dining room to get Kate's heart at the ocean diamond to have a stalking scene and then cool fight in the water which is pretty much a hallmark of James Cameron by the way this guy is played by David Warner you might remember him as Chancellor gorkon from Star Trek 6 he was also on Star Trek 5 the final frontier you know I have a watch Star Trek 5 in a long time may every I'll give it a look then we have that pointless modern-day mystery subplot about the hunt for the diamond things were set up that this was some kind of treasure hunt mystery movie - what happened to the diamond the old lady will give us clues no one remembers this stuff about the Titanic you're probably could have eliminated that entire part of the movie and not lost any of the emotional impact plus this old bag sucked at acting and I can still smell the fresh paint so wonder Titanic go from this to this well you see legend has it the Cameron didn't even know about the Celine Dion song at first here's blank - and the movie would just score music but then James Horner wrote the song and they recorded it in secret and then they give it to him any listens to it and he's like yeah okay yeah I guess we could use this that's fine it's fine that a movie finds its footing or a different angle after the fact cop-out was changed from bad to much worse in editing or whether Cameron wanted to make an action movie with the dash of romance or a romance with the dash of action it doesn't really matter I'm exploring why people hate this movie and I think a great deal of the reason is because that stupid song but if the cast all that aside you got a really good movie a movie that looks amazing and has some really great scenes and performances but most importantly it wasn't to slap together quick Hollywood cash grab not that all movies that aren't slapped together turn out good but this one literally has it all and you could see the time and care that was taken in every aspect Titanic is a three hour movie it doesn't feel its length it's true epic filmmaking and you've got to give it a nod for that regardless if Titanic was a simplistic story it's a special-effects masterpiece in my opinion utilizing almost every technique imaginable Titanic was made in the Golden Age of special-effects in my opinion the mid-90s yes this was back in 96 and 97 when we still did things with real people and real sets a magical special time when CGI was a new tool that was used only to enhance certain shots but not to create them entirely like today's movies do which looks a fucking fake Titanic relied on real sets and miniature models of all different scales Titanic achieves the best  compliment of all in terms of visualeffects the fact that most things you don't notice is a visual effect  miniature engine sets and turbines at different scales lots of physical stuntsmixed alongside digital people flooding the actual sets with actors in them full-scale sets cut right along with miniature sets and so on when a movie can make this look like this you know stop the line moviemaking but let's move on to the part that everybody wants to hear about how the movie fucking suck yeah number six haters gonna hate now let's talk about the bad this movie has the ability to highly irritate its audience in several ways you see only Rosa McGowan is likable on screen she's a fantastic actress doing what she can with the shitty script she also has a great rack hey you fuck that room up 80 by Leo on the other hand is possibly the worst actor since Jim Barney's coffin lets us know where we rank in the scheme of things started out as a stupid kid sidekick on a show called growing pains and like most child actors he probably wouldn't have made it as an adult if he wasn't lucky as a child after first sort of like Natalie Portman she was sexy as the kid in the professional but later she proved to be a hack as an adult starring in such flop films as your highness brothers Thor and Garden State if cancer were pretentious it would beGarden State he's good like her boring monotone performances were not simply limited to Queen armadillo I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to rule and like DiCaprio she only excelled in two types of acting playing a retard and yelling but when push came to shove neither could really act Wow they simply portrayed actors and movies and survived on their good looks and prior hit films even Martin Scorsese ruined several of his own movies by casting Leo in them I'm telling you something's wrong it must have lost a bet there are some exceptions to the rule of course but most child actors grow up to be talentless hacks actors like Drew Barrymore Corey Feldman Corey Haim Macaulay Culkin Gary Coleman Danny Bonaduce and Kevin Bacon but to be fair it's not all Leo's fault even though his talent is limited to shouting the script is filled with terrible and embarrassing dialogue that probably wouldn't sound good coming from any actor walked about a mile around this boat deck and chewed over how great the weather's been and how I grew up with Rick and that's not why he came to talk to me is it the movie was also a cornball fest that would make Roger Corman blush James Cameron can write utilitarian dialogue that moves the plot along I'll be back and he excels at writing science fiction and action stories and set pieces that's his element however people romance and period dialogue is not as strongest suit don't do a period don't do a period it's deadly you know yeah period movies are deadly they're also pretty bloody too  everywhere have I seen this beforeKate everybody wants to spin you round and round this is bad dialogue not as bad as of course objective like what my wife says I want a divorce and that her next line is screaming and cut and scene perfect oh that's good dialogue that's on the lines and Titanic our real head scratchers most come from Wisconsin's own Jack Dawson or Billy Zane's character Clifford Huxtable comical one-dimensional characters that feel like someone's putting an SOS pad in your ears oh I guess I mean a cqd pad in your ears ow hair let me share something with you I'm sure he can't wait jack says open the gate and then since that didn't work he decides to try I gotta work then when some poor man is praying Jack pushes a man acts like an asshole you unimaginable bastard finite a dollar for every time someone called me that five minutes I dunno they were going on Titanic shut the fuck up nobody asked you so this scene was supposed to introduce Lovejoy is a clever adversary but the fake situation I thought was out Leo saved her from falling over the side of the ship while she tried to look at the propeller blades right but then Lovejoy says this the young lady slipped so suddenly and you still had time your jackets and your shoes certainly have said it's curious that you took off your jacket and your shoes for some reason like why did you do that I thought this Lovejoy guy was supposed to be some kind of fucking former cop more like a former retard and a current retard to add insult to injury some audience pandering dialogue is thrown in for good measure Cameron knows this film is appealing to the dumb masses so he writes in some groaners like something because so we  won't about to a thing okay I got itwell trust me Kenzi stupid she cut it out I get it already do you know if dr. Freud mysteries me oh and Sigmund Freud we've heard of him Freud who is he yes let's not forget that some awkward dialogue will always lead to unintentional sexual innuendo don't tell me you weren't a little uncomfortable when Leo and Fabrizio were practicing for their float position in the gay pride parade but rich do even talks about his genitals each side it's been 84 years let's stretch your legs no no just with their hands I'm getting off with here it was a dreadful heavy thing you would have gone straight to the bottom any room for a gentleman gentleman early women at this time so well Jack sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot number eight the story and similarities like jar jar binks you can cite Jack and Kate is the annoying reason why I hate this film but it runs a lot deeper pun intended things you might not have noticed but your brain did if they're Titanic at all the glitz and glamour of old Hollywood attractive star-crossed lovers a mustache twirling villain you know you don't want somebody who's a mustache twirling shut up I'm talking amazing such state-of-the-art visual effects action and an awesome score by James Horner to tug it your heartstrings but when the characters in the story are laughably simplistic it harms the overall product in fact old Hollywood was more complex and story and characters the Titanic is a story in itself one of the more popular Titanic films a night to remember told the story of Titanic without fictional characters and subplots but most Titanic movies relied on this to create the dramatic connection and a focus for the audience compared to even the hallmark TV movie of the week Cameron's Titanic plot and characters are embarrassingly bad and simplistic let's recap Jack Dawson a free-spirited adventurous guy loves arc and he sees people see people Kate Winslet young beautiful but also sad she loves art just like jack personally she has no faults other than a tendency towards suicide Kate's mom wants money cliff huxtable has money objectifies women  beats women and tries to shoot women healso has no faults so these are pretty simple and predictable characters you don't got to be under Casey to predict the events in this movie now some of you might be saying to yourself there was a made-for-tv Titanic movie like at the same time James Cameron's Titanic came out or yes there was truth be told Cameron I've been working on Titanic well before this thing came out not sure what the connection is between them and if there is any so we'll go  with the chicken and the egg logic herebut what cambric pointed out is a series of odd similarities between these two movies and other Titanic movies that came out before it's obvious though that with the movie based on a historical event you will have similarities the ship are an iceberg the band will play on til the end  Isidor and Ida Straus to stay on the ship together for tax purposes and so on a lot of the dialogue scenes and the way events unfolded will be based on passenger accounts and recollections testimony from survivors and so on aren't you going to try for it mr. Andrews everyone's to put on warm clothing get their life belts on and go up on let them see you wearing it put it on child for your own self - you forgot to put on your life no shit has about an out of there the ship will sink get your wife and children into the boat thank you and get to a boss quickly don't wait what's the use no one's listening what's the use nobody's listening to us anymore people don't listen when they're eating but we play Jeff's the same well they don't listen to us a dinner honor why did the British find it necessary to announce dinner as if it were a cavalry charge announcing dinner like a damn camera  retard come - aw babeI've been looking color right Bruce it's a mathematical certainty it is a mathematical certainty our similarities might have been more specific things like shots or visuals lifted from other films the way certain scenes played out could be direct references to older Titanic movies or maybe taken from that book by Walter Lord I don't know because I never read it I don't read things the only thing I've ever read was the directions to my flashlight how do you turn this thing on I got to change the tire thank you for I'm a healthier oh I've got a question about an order I've received all right may I have your order number no why I don't have her is it a question just about the item the question about the item don't work right okay what's the item that's item zero eight zero a the Tegan Presley pussy that's a flashlight okay what's your question I don't see a place to put batteries in it as far as I know the flashlight doesn't take batteries flashlight not take batteries okay have you ever had one before sir oh yeah friend of the mom my life you've had flashlights all your life they've only been out for a few years this is the thing is it's dark in my garage I'm trying to change a flat tire on my car I can't see what I'm doing okay let me look up your order what's your last name blanket mr. blanket be a lion kgt and what's your zip code please I don't know it's in New Jersey 0:08 for one pl you said it starts with a P as in Peter plin ket P Spears and penis that's right okay mr. Flint Gail we don't have you on file I'm thinking that you bought that from somewhere but flashlights do not take batteries well how do they turn on they don't turn on but unser you did not water that from us oh my god I have to go my cat's fucking my flashlight alright have a good day bye bye anyways when in a lot of cases the similarity is too striking not to mention it's all too much for even me to sort out I'm too busy to deal with most of it my point is the general construction of a Titanic movie has been written before but can essentially write itself and things can even be lifted from other films without the threat of plagiarism because it's been told so  many times before if you know thehistory and the timeline of events you've got yourself a movie - Sara c-grade one-dimensional soap opera love story and you've got yourself the most successful film ever however they did attempt to apply this formula unsuccessfully I might add to the 2001 film Pearl Harbor it's turned out to be a four hour long nightmare of schlock it's like some asshole said when you're not attack Jana cuz we love money whether historical event can we slap a love triangle into ripoff Titanic's famous bow kiss scene by trying to do the same shit with the plane however Bruckheimer and BAE's cynical cash grab failed to impress even Mongoloids and the film even starred two of them Cameron's Titanic is what they call lightning in a bottle can't always be explained all the pieces of the puzzle fit perfectly but all the pieces were already in place in many ways I'm only married itself the actual story of the Titanic what happened in 1912 how the disaster came to be just became endlessly fascinating to me you couldn't have written it better it's like a great novel let's take a look at the 1996 hallmark TV movie Titanic and our main  characters I noticed some interestingsimilarities first off we've got these two characters Jamie and Jack both names start with J both guys got blonde hair and they're poor guys both started off at a bar in the Titanic Fork town they run through the streets and they got a ticket to Titanic that didn't originally belong to them down on the ship they're both realise they got shitty clothes what's wrong with my bloody suit to put on a tuxedo that doesn't belong to them and they end up in first class and both also have an awkward conversation with John Jacob Astor us move on Zack a Ferengi two Jones's character Isabella she's a lady that's a little disillusioned by the show of high society kinda like Kate Winslet she's in kind of a boring loveless marriage back home in the States but she hooks back up with someone she used to be in love with someone who's not supposed to be with  and that excites her vaginal thatexcites her virginal and I think that excited her vag oh and that excites her vaginal bikini bad Jonah Dan the movie he also dies their tragic love story I was sinking in the Atlantic Ocean so fucking romantic Kate Winslet was also disillusioned by the socialite crowd and lifestyle and chose the allure of forbidden love she was supposed to marry cliff so the idea of running off with Jack also excited your vag Allah so the idea of running off with Jack also excited her bug loan begins Oh Val go the Gugu budge Allah vicuna squish box but despite these curious character and visual similarities the previous Titanic movies were all infinitely more complex with the dramatic situations and characters than Cameron's flop film there is even more shower rape - I mean who didn't get raped on the Titanic by Tim Curry oh yeah number 9 screenplay and film anal sis Titanic represents top-of-the-line moviemaking in terms of action direction and effective scenes which come out of nowhere and surprise you in fact one of the best scenes in this film is this one Frances Fisher delivers a great performances Kate's mother with the soul piercing eyes there's a nice visual metaphor here with the corset being tightened around Kate and they even bring up the whole women's  rights angle that was beginning to takeshape at the time you know women voting scenes like this one in the scene where Thomas Andrews tells them that the ship is gonna sink with the ship bouncy she's made of iron sir I assure you she can our short to the point dramatic and  effective moral of problems is thatTitanic lacks more of these scenes they make up just 1.3 percent of the whole  movie the rest indulges in the less realistic and comically simplisticromance in class stereotyping the Cameron is now known for the real-life  historical characters on the ship aretreated much like the sets accurate in the visual sense but lacking any  realistic emotional depth there was aneffort on Jim's part to make these people look the way their photographs  look he cast people based upon theirappearance there's a nice little scene in the 1996 Titanic when Isabella talks with John Jacob Astor's new young and pregnant wife Madeline talk about divorce feminine-hygiene and lady things like that these things seem like they can never work out but somehow they do life is so short Isabella beside  anytime is there they're singing addedsome realistic depth to both characters while scenes like this are missing from Cameron's Titanic much like Avatar Cameron here goes for simplistic stereotyping in his writing on Titanic the first-class passengers are made out to be comically one-dimensional ignorant stuffy characters all the third-class  passengers have real heart and know how to party even their children are cute and perfect everyone's perfect whileit's true that there is a world of difference between the first and third  class accommodations and the third classpeople generally got the shaft when the ship sunk real people in real history it's not so black and white dark Janek felt more like a Saturday morning cartoon show version of the story from a historical perspective the characters in the film don't feel real especially Jack Dawson that's what I have our time mustering a tear for him when he gets frozen and sinks below the ocean oh by the way science called they said that bodies float the movie asks you to like Kate our lead you can tell that she's had strong independent well-read artsy and could probably  accomplish a lot more in her life than being a vapid socialite applying allthese basic tacked-on traits makes you want to root for her because she's held back by her comically evil fiance on the other hand she's propped up by Jack a guy who seems to always know where to go and what to do he knows everything somehow including the physics of what will happen when a 45,000 ton vessel sinks in the water he's selfless and flawless then there's examples of the obstructing lower-ranking crew members on Titanic as either assholes jerks dickheads fuckwads come along you cowards spineless pussy men I'm sure they all weren't little bitches but it helps the simplicity of this script at least the movie showed is may looking somewhat remorseful in the lifeboat it wasn't counting his money or complaining or something like that in real life you probably had a lot of first-class rich guys who were super nice and we're really good family men and third-class guys that were drunk assholes who beat their wives but in James Cameron's little brain people fit into categories according to their class where the tables and light fixtures were perfectly accurate but the comical interpretation of the people wasn't now I used to term one-dimensional a lot so let me expand on that Rosa's mother has a good scene in this movie you almost feel sorry for at this moment so there's this and then there's a scene when cliff says both characters have a fleeting glimpse of some depth but never returns and it may have all been fraudulent anyways all throughout the movie roses  mother acts like a fucking horribleperson she says with complete sincerity but University is a place to find asuitable husband Rose has already done that what a bitch she orders around all the maids and acts like a clueless cunt I'd like a cup of tea when I return now she's either playing the act of being a first-class rich woman or she really is a selfish monster and this scene was all for show this certainly doesn't act like a woman who's terrified of losing her good name and becoming poor someone rose-leaves you feel almost no sympathy towards her thus detaching any emotional interest in anything happening a simple trick would have been to show her looking more worried about Jack Dawson rather than  looking filled with hatred and disgustthe mothers internal conflict of having to marry off her daughter in exchange for her happiness could have made her a more interesting character same goes with Huxtable he could have easily been portrayed as a kind of sad lonely rich guy maybe he spent his whole life acquiring this fortune and didn't have time for love he could be awkward and kind of inconsiderate because he doesn't know how to treat a woman but as quarry didn't need to be evil and certainly wouldn't try to murder anyone I guess if you need some action maybe have his manservant try to kill them for some other personal reason maybe cliff could try to stop him from trying to murder them and he gets shot in the process you know some depth but instead huxtable becomes a mustache twirler the real villain in the film should have just been the iceberg that's the way to win over her heart buddy conversely Jack's only detriment is that he litters hey you're gonna go get that it talks you cared about the environment what a hypocrite unsubscribed seems silly to spend 200 million dollars on a movie and not have interesting characters oh there's a guys here that  Disney bought Star Wars I don't see whatthe big deal is I bought Star Wars I got it for 20 bucks at Target over there  always thanked my wife please Ben Kate'smotivations for changing her mind about the entire course of her life and dooming her mother to a life of poverty is based on this witnessing a little girl being instructed on how to be a  proper lady while visually poetic itsoverly simplistic Rose breaks the cycle and learns how to stick ride a horse buy a plane and not be a trophy wife to some closeted gay in  a toupee don't give me that jazz the groan inducing Lane plot does allow for visually cinematic moments like thefamous bow kiss scene the idea of the scene is very creative though the cinematography at sunset the music the emotion all the elements of moving your audience are in play here to perfection which is what a good movie does your reaction to this kind of stuff will put you in one of two categories a romantic or a cynic however while Cameron understands real people about as much as George Lucas the man can't write a screenplay like nobody's business except for the dialogue part what I was thinking was what could have happened to this girl to make her think she had no way out despite what I consider an unnecessary modern-day subplot it's a tight script filled with wonderful little moments details and setups and payoffs here are some now Kate doesn't just find her rape whistle it's set up ahead of time the knife Fabrizio wins in  the poker game he later uses to cut theropes on the lifeboat Lovejoy's gun is established and shown to cliff which comes into play later Rose learns how to spit from Jack and then later uses the skill against cliff right in his face now you might be thinking that these all sound like really small pointless and obvious things and yes yes they are but the point is a lot of scripts don't even bother with tiny setups like this when they don't you find yourself saying oh I guess he's just got a gun now okay oh she just spit in his face okay it's kind of weird but I guess it worked it's got away Hey look that guy just happened to have a whistle that she could use that's convenient you see brief setups avoid confusion later the less questions people ask inside their own brains the more they'll enjoy the film dilled car is established Jack knowing how cool the viewers at the bow of the ship is established he may not have written the most real the characters but for someone who was making a 200 million dollar budget movie at least he understands the basics of screenwriting Oh there are all lot of smaller details that show the Cameron has a good grasp on the visuals as well these are really small things but worth mentioning because an artist's little things like captain Smith's foreboding sunken lemon in his teeth next if you notice when Jack proposes a toast roses mother is the only one who doesn't raise her glass or drink very subtle it's in the background that makes sense and then when Kate enters the afterlife for whatever it is Captain Smith is the last person to be seen applauding as the captain is always to last off the ship number 10 sink or swim but as Titanic survived this review does it sink or swim well the real Titanic sunk I think in this reviewers opinion it's split right down the middle no pun intended technically the Titanic didn't split down the middle it's split between the third and fourth funnels but just not really in half it's more closer to 2/3 check your facts before you say something what what the fuck unsubscribe or you check your facts who are you check your facts oh I know all the facts you little asshole I got them in my brain so let's recap and break it down James Cameron's Titanic is a filled with stuff we're all familiar with and have seen before be predictable with flat and simplistic characters so what's the appeal well my interest in the movie lies more in a technical and historical I don't think that's the case for 99% of the movie-going audience just fellas in theaters for nearly an entire year and had sellout crowds over and over again why not cause Titanic have realistic compelling characters rocked with emotional conflict are therefore must say that my Titanic review results in this conclusion most people are dumb and don't like to  be challenged intellectually oremotionally they like to familiar and gravitate towards things that feel safe and non-confrontational Titanic as a movie played it safe the things I suggested to add depth to the characters were disregarded James Cameron isn't a lousy screenwriter he might in fact be a fucking genius of some kind whether it's emotional familiarity vicarious fantasy romance simple adventure and excitement sci-fi action and danger or cheap thrills and laughs these are movies and this is what people love about them the ability to vicariously transport yourself into a fantasy world away from your boring day job as a bank teller a CPA or a Tollbooth operator but it's not just emotion and escapism the success of movies often comes in their simplicity just like how most newspapers are written on the 4th grade reading level you see the average human IQ is 100 so if you want your film to make money you've got to aim for average I just heard that you have to see it this is so full of human drama has all of life in it when the romance played a big role in the movie I think just look at the top box-office films of all time and then consider suicide it's the reason why quality film like Hugo earned nearly 10 times less than a movie like Shrek 2 directors like Cameron and Spielberg are masters at pulling at those all-important heartstrings with some exceptions they are the makers of the movie versions of Applebee's Panera Bread and TGI Fridays exceptionalism is the exception my friends the brilliant complex and challenging falls to the wayside while the safe and the familiar is the norm so this is why I can't say officially that Titanic is a bad movie you see Titanic aimed for the middle and it hits a muck perfectly Titanic makes you step back and look at the bigger more depressing picture that were mostly creatures of habit and we're all average I'm sorry and so so sorry number eleven what really happened when James Cameron made Titanic it was only about ten years since they discovered the wreck the official conclusion before then despite some testimony to the contrary was that the ship sunk intact when Robert Ballard discovered the Titanic it was in two pieces so it was proven that the break-up did occur Cameron and all the experts at the time thought the ship went up as high as a 30 degree angle and then the weight caused it to crack in later years these fat guys would find pieces of the bottom of the ship and some evidence would suggest that the ship didn't get so high up in the air and that caved in word and then broke probably below the waterline truth is most people are lying about what really happened and don't know shit cuz I was there you see my mother father and I stowed away aboard the Titanic and some luggage because my father was too cheap to buy tickets my mother and I left our luggage in the middle of the night well my father was left to drown in this suitcase poor bastard you see no one was on the bridge that fateful night those assholes were all in the back smoking and drinking I was only six years old at the time so I thought it would be fun to go up and play with the big steering wheel done my friend Tony appeared in the form of a pizza roll steer the ship into that iceberg come on it'll be fun so I did just that now no one wanted to admit that a six-year-old crashed their fancy new ship into an iceberg so they all agreed to make up the whole story but the iceberg right ahead and hard to starboard and all that bullshit and another thing the ship didn't crack in half it was blasted in half by a UFO I thought happened from the lifeboat I was in did you really have to do that aliens when the ship's fuckin sinking by itself here we didn't need that and my mother was fuckin the captain in this cabin because you know what they say the captain is the last to get off thank you for watching my review don't forget to stop by my web connection www rattle of legend comm you can see all the other reviews have made there my cat's beam is too stuck on flashlight
