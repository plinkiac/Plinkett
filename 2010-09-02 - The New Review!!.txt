Arise, Lord Plinkett.
The time has come.
Ain't nobody asked you.
What?
Quiet your facehole.
I have foreseen this day for a long, long time.
Yeah, my new review is done.
It's Star Trek.
What?
I just finished it yesterday.
What?
It's up on my webzone, redlettermedia.com.
You have failed me for the last time.
Look, I'll review Episode III next, I guess.
Probably.
I just needed a break from Star Wars.
What in the fuck is Star Wars?
Huh?
Your destiny was to review Mobile Suit Gundam Crossfire, and how it totally ruined Kidou Senshi Ze Gundam: Hot Scramble.
It was total bullshit that they would even release a game like that for PlayStation.
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you at the mall?
I had to pick up a few things.
Look, I have this list.
Next, you will need to review Metal Gear 3.
Then after that, you should review Dragonball Z: Bardock, The Father of Goku.
Hey.
Hey, stop.
And lastly, you should review the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King expansion pack...
Hey, quiet.
...and how it totally ruined the first expansion pack...
Hey, quiet.
...called Burning Crusade.
And that basically ruined World of Warcraft.
Hey, stop.
Do you have an erection?
Yes.
