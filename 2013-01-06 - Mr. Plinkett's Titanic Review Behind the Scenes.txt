On camera, it'll be more pur-, like it'll be dark so that lines will stick out more, and might look...
Well, the, the wizard is the funny...We are preparing for our failure with, um, with our gigantic Titanic snow globe.
We couldn't find a real Titanic snow globe, um, so we had to fabricate one, and this was the smallest Titanic model I could find.
The likelihood of this working is, is nil.
But we're gonna glue the base on and then flip it over and hopefully it's watertight.
Wh-, what, do you think the chances are of this working?
Well, I believe in everything, so I think it's going to work perfectly.
All right, some optimism.
What do you think the chances are this working?
I'm really scared.
Maybe a little higher than 1%.
Maybe 1 & 1/2.
Yeah, it looks good.
Oh, yeah, the water makes it larger-looking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here we go.
All right.
That's good on smoke, and...action.
Here's my Titanic snow globe.
Isn't it big?Let me go have the Navi take a picture with it.
Like that?
Yeah.
We're gonna blow up the Titanic.
We're gonna reveal what really happened.
What really happened?
Uh, oh, a spacecraft came down and shot the ship in half.
So, we've rigged, uh, we've rigged this part up.
We split it and rigged it with explosives, little bombs, and a bunch of debris.
Yes.
So we're gonna dip it in the water with this base.
Uh, hopefully prop it up.
And then shoot in slow motion, and hopefully it breaks properly.
Hopefully it breaks properly, or at least explodes in a way that looks cool.
Yeah.
We'll see.
You've gotta be kidding me.
It was a dud.
So, ironically enough, we can't get the Titanic to sink
Yeah, yeah!
Oh, my god.
Fucking finally.
It sunk slowly, too.
Oh, good.
