Plinkett: Star Wars The Last Jedi is the most embarrassing thing since my son. No, no, my other son, the son, that's so embarrassing. I never even talked about him. His name is Ryan Johnson and he's a filmmaker from Los Angeles, California. In all honesty, though, after lubing up the last Jedi and subjecting it to a very deep and tight analysis, I have discovered that it is a slightly more complex and interesting film than I first thought. Complexly bad!
["Finn! Get up, we gotta go!"]
It both succeeds and fails for me at the same time, kind of like falling on your face at the finish line of an Olympic race. And maybe shitting your pants at the same time. That's The Last Jedi. that was also my cousin Howard at the 92 Barcelona Olympics. He later became an alcoholic and then crashed his car into a Burger King. When his car exploded, that made him die. You could say he was flame-broiled. What a sad ending to a man who famously shit his pants in front of the whole world. Anyway, speaking of famously shitting your pants in front of the whole world: 1), Ryan Johnson and how this all happened. Disney, Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, whoever, whatever, gave my son the most important sequel in a billion dollar franchise. It really only made one other movie in the genre. And it was called Looper. It was pretty okay, I guess. Other than that, he hasn't done too much. He used to mow my fucking lawn. One time he added fertilizer to my overgrown grass and made it worse. He told me he was subverting my expectations. I told him to go fuck himself. I fired him. And I didn't let him mow another lawn again. Now my son was given the unenviable task of having to follow up The Force Awakens with his own film, We all know that The Force Awakens was a soft reboot of A New Hope. So all the internet fingers of blame were all prepared to point right at Rian and accuse him of doing the same thing with Episode VIII, which was that he was gonna make a soft reboot of Empire. And for a while, it seemed to be that. And he knew it. Here we had a movie set after the destruction of the First Order's superweapon. Rey was seeking out a Jedi Master for training, about to discover some kind of family secret or lineage. The rebellion was running and gonna get betrayed, and then go into hiding again, etc, etc. So one can't necessarily blame my son for trolling the audience and "subverting expectations."
["The whole thing of a scoundrel and the audience expects him to have a heart of gold. My intent is to cast someone who you would not expect to see. The only thing I would really want is a good movie that delights me in ways I didn't expect. Not getting what she wants. Not getting the answers from the places she thought they were going to come from, like, "Oh, that's completely different than I thought it was."]
Plinkett: But my question is, why troll the situation at all? Why not take the audience in an entirely new direction? Oh, I guess because there's nowhere to go with Star Wars. Cuz it's boring. It's played out. And it sucks. Lucas is laughing all the way to the bank with his $4 billion check. God bless you, George. You enjoy your food court meals. you sweet, sweet man. Anyway, the similarities first started with the trailer. Vader and Kyle Ren, alone, on a mission to find someone. I guess we'll call him "Vaderen". AT-AT Walkers preparing for an attack on what looks like a snow planet. Vaderen entering with snow troopers. Rey training with the Jedi Master on some kind of green place filled with life. Rey confronting her fears in a secret cave. Vaderen Force-senses somebody on a ship. And so on. But when you see the movie, the snow planet battle is at the end. Oh, my god, it's not snow at all. It's salt!
["Salt."]
Plinkett: You're gonna rub that in our wounds, son? Hey, wait, is that Gareth Edwards? Put a fucking helmet on, you stupid prick. No one cares that you have a cameo, you boring ass cracker. Jesus Christ, how full themselves are these guys?
["Someday this war is gonna end. Not the Star Wars that will never end We'll keep going forever."]
Plinkett: Keep going forever? What the fuck? Son, you may have single-handedly ended it! Oh, surprise. Rey doesn't good trained by Luke at all. And her family lineage isn't a shocking secret.
["You have no place in this story. You come from nothing. You're nothing."]
Plinkett: And there's no real lightsaber fight at all. At least not IRL. It's all a hoax! Oh, my god. Seriously, though, this guy literally just did pretty much the opposite of what we expected. Did he think all this was going to blow our fucking minds? The only thing that could blow my mind is a giant pile of Tony Montana cocaine. God, I miss the 80's. The 1880's! That's when you could get the real good stuff. The 1980's was okay, I guess, but I'm really looking forward to the 2080's. Digital 3-D printed cocaine, sponsored by Disney. Snort up before before you see Star Wars Episode 47: The Last Last Last Last Last Last Las-- oh, wait, there's more.
["Yes, failure most of all."]
Plinkett: You see all this shit that I've just talked about is what we know already, and what we've complained about ad nauseum. The whole internet collectively has complained about...subverting expectations...out of place your mama joke...
["About his mother."]
Plinkett: Porgs...Luke throws a lightsaber over his shoulder...coyotes made of crystal meth...stupid kids...BB-8 is a slot machine that shoots coins at people...Luke milks giant dinosaur tits...stupid kids...Kylo Ren wears old man high-rise pants...Luke Skywalker drinks milk from dinosaur tits like a homeless slob...Leia flies like Peter Pan in space...stupid kids...cartoon alien horse donkeys...purple hair lady in a prom dress...Luke tells Rey the Jedi aren't special...
["That Force does not belong to the Jedi."]
Plinkett: ...contradicting all the other Star Wars films.
["The reading is off the chart. Over 20,000."]
Plinkett: Silly Yoda. So silly! Luke's robot hand vanishes into the Force. An emo chat live. What we don't really talk about is just how terrible the script is. It's like Rian Johnson wrote one draft, turned it in, and then everyone said, "Sure, let's go with it," without asking any questions that -- wait a minute, where have I heard this before?
["Well, see, again -- I mean, I told Rian, this is no surprise, I said I just fundamentally disagree with your concept of this character."]
Number two: The worst screenplay ever...is probably It's Pat? Or maybe Jack and Jill. Or possibly The Mummy. There's a lot of contenders, but it's certainly not The Last Jedi.
["Rian delivered a great script. Very ambitious. We...a lot of surprises."]
Plinkett: It has its moments, and yes, I'm gonna be totally fair here: it feels like it was written by a high school student. But, like, like a pretty smart high school student. One who thought about a script really really hard at home before he had to go to bed at night.
["Rian Johnson communicated really clearly his intent for the shots very early on. He actually drew storyboards."]
Plinkett: Like Empire, The Last Jedi opens with the Rebellion fleeing their current base because they've been found out by the First Order. In Empire, we get a little establishment of location, some character stuff with Han, Leia, Luke, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2...you know, characters we like. We also learn and understand how the Empire track them down. This shit just started wild right out of the gate. So you say to yourself, "I guess it doesn't really matter how the First Order found the Rebel base, right?" But, you know, it adds something. A little something called realism. And pacing, too. Build up. All those wonderful things that make up movies. The Empire probably spent years searching the galaxy with random space probes to find the Rebels. They had no fucking clue where they were. The first Order just shows up out of nowhere right out of the bat.
["Oh, no."]
Plinkett: The First Order comes off as comically powerful. With unlimited resources. It kind of makes you wonder, "Why are they even bothering chasing down an elderly lady and all of her friends who only have a handful of spaceships?" The fuck are they gonna do? None of this has helped either by the fact that Tom Hall Gleason's acting is straight out of Spaceballs.
["Who do you think you're talking to?"]
["Prepare ship -- prepare ship for...ludicrous speed."]
Plinkett: What's the matter, Colonel Sanders? Turkey?! The robots are the goofy ones, not the bad guys!
["Hello?"]
["Hello, yup. Still here."]
Plinkett: Then their plan appears to be this: Poe flies his X-Wing in front of the Dreadnought ship as a distraction. He then goes into attack mode with the intention of taking out the surface cannons, right?
["He's cleaning out our surface cannons!"]
Plinkett: He does this so that the bombers can bomb away. They're in the middle of doing this whole plan because they had all their bombers out and ready to attack. This appears to buy them the time to get the last transport off the ground before the Dreadnought can fire its super cannons, which are located underneath the ship, down at the Rebel base, and blow it up. Here's a thought for the First Order. You have two clear targets, and you have super cannons. Should you blow up a planetary base that's deserted and isn't going anywhere, or should you aim those super cannons over here, and fire at the big fleet ship that's poised to jump to lightspeed at any moment? You know, you could always blow up the base at your convenience. Or leave a couple Star Destroyers there. I doubt the Rebellion would come back to a base that's been found. Plus, maybe down on that base, they left some stuff about other Rebels, or other locations, fleet strength, crew dossiers, important belongings, data chips with information on them. Stuff they couldn't really get in a hurry. You know, I think in military terms, they call that intelligence. But, clearly, the script is missing that. Ah, fuck it, just blow up the base.
["Fire on the base!"]
Plinkett: Why not? Just blow it up. Everyone in the First Order is so fucking wildly angry for no real reason.
["He'll never penetrate our armor."]
["He's not trying to penetrate our armor."]
["Open fire!"]
["We need to scramble our fighters!"]
["Concentrate all fire on the speeders!"]
["Fire on the base!"]
Plinkett: Old school Empire guys were just coldly doing their job. They weren't fucking frothing at the mouth. What are these people, insane? Anyhoo, so I'm still talking about this scene. So the last transport has made it.
["The last transport's in the air. The evacuation is complete"]
Plinkett: Leia is happy, and says to Poe, "Okay, I guess call out that whole bomber mission thing, and bring your slow-ass moving bombers back to the fleet. You know, so that Dreadnought can shoot at you -- and us -- while you head back with your slow-ass moving bombers." Poe rightly says, "No, General, we can do this, we have the chance to take out a Dreadnought!" Hey, Leia, while we're all here, let's at least try to take this thing out, right, because that was kind of our mission in the first place?
["We got to take out that last cannon, or our bombers are toast!"]
Plinkett: Like, that's what we're here doing. And if we don't, it will kill us all. Leia is upset by this plan because she has no idea what she's doing. She could barely even stand up. Time to give it up and go with the Yoda floating wheelchair. Poe also states that this thing -- the Dreadnought -- is a fleet killer.
["These things are fleet killers, we can't let it get away!"]
["Disengage now, Commander, that is an order--"]
But, like, this is the last of their fleet. There are no other Rebellion fleets, right?
["400 of us on three ships...we are the very last of the resistance."]
Plinkett: So why not just get the fuck out of there? I can see why Chinese audiences were so confused that this movie how two feuding militaries could do things that make absolutely no sense in a movie called Star Wars. Box office-speaking, they don't really like this movie. I think it's probably because it was written by some pudgy white folk singer from California, who has probably never hurt a fly. The military tactics in this movie make about as much sense as me buying condoms. Number one, my wife is dead. Number two, I could no longer gotten a reaction. And number three, my cat ripped off my penis in 1969. Here's the real audio. I was recording my reaction to the first moon landing at the time. "Hey, kitty kat, look, this is amazing. Man on the Moon. Live on television. Could you believe it, kitty? Could you -- owww!" Anway, sure, the can-you-hear-me-now-your-mama-prank-phone-call part was stupid. As was the BB-8 plugging water leaks gag boarded on Looney Tunes reality. But the real underlying problem with this movie was a lot of the logic. Logic that was glossed over by great-looking visual effects, fast paced action, and excitement. You really can't fault how great this movie looks. But right from the first scene, there was something off about the writing. And like I always say, you might not have noticed it, but your brain did. Number three, tl;dw. Another problem with the script for The Last Jedi is the fact that there's just too much stuff. 
["Uh, so when we put the whole movie together, we had a very big movie. It was too big. It's too long, too much stuff. So right now I am signing the final budget sheet. So..."] Plinkett: while every Star Wars film is just over two hours long, this one takes the cake at two hours and 30 minutes. And in my opinion, storywise, should have ended around the one hour and 45 minute mark. Somehow all this stuff with Snoke and the confrontation with Rey and Kylo felt like a climax. As did the Admiral Holdo lightspeed kamikaze attack. But, this is all problem with structure. So let's talk about that. While the Snoke throne room scene is clearly reminiscent of Return of the Jedi, I'm going to compare The last Jedi to the Empire Strikes Back, of course. In Empire, we have sort of a bow-like storyline structure, where our characters are together, then go off on separate adventures, then all end up at the same place for the conclusion. Sitcom-format speaking, you have an A-story and a B-story. In Empire, clearly Luke's training with Yoda and learning about the Force and then having to confront Darth Vader is the A-storyline. In The Last Jedi, we have four C-stories. I don't even know how that fucking works. Equal time seems to be given to everything that's going on in the film, and nothing seems to have more weight than anything else. Plus, things that kind of seemed important just sort of end, more or less unresolved. Plus, we are treated to the old domino-effect-of-bad-decisions screenwriting model. A model I think works better in a comedy film. Which leads me to my next point. Number four, a comedy of errors. The Last Jedi script kind of plays out like a madcap comedy film.
["So a stormtrooper and a who-now are doing what?"]
Plinkett: At least the Rebellion aspects of it do. Let's take a look at a random comedy film. How about National Lampoon's Vacation? So just how did the Griswold family turn their vacation into an armed hostage situation? Well, let's start at the end. Clark has a gun and uses it to take hostages. Clark buys the gun from a gun store. He got the gun because, when they got to Walley World, it was too late and it was closed.
["Clark, what are you doing?"]
Plinkett: An unwelcome passenger, Aunt Edna, dies in their car, forcing them to get rid of the body. Clark robs a motel register in Arizona. Clark robbed the motel because he had no money because the mechanic scammed him.
["How much you got?"]
Plinkett: Clark got lost trying to find the Grand Canyon, w\hich caused him to crash his car, which caused it to need repairs. Clark gets suckered into taking Aunt Edna along when they stop at cousin Eddie's. Clark takes the wrong exit and ends up in the ghetto and gets his car vandalized. And Clark got sold the wrong car in the first place, because he was stupid.
["I'm not your ordinary everyday fool, okay?"]
Plinkett: Clark's general incompetence cascades into a series of events, which cause things on their family vacation to get worse and worse. It's because he's dumb, and he makes bad decisions. Like getting a gun out of rage. Driving fast to impress Christie Brinkley. Trying to find the Grand Canyon by looking for it. Falling asleep at the wheel. Constantly getting scammed by people everywhere because he's dumb and from Chicago. See, that's why he's a funny character, because he's a phone.
["Waitress."]
Plinkett: The same can be argued for most of the characters in The Last Jedi. The Rebels end up with only a dozen people left alive, out of about 400.
["400 of us on three ships."]
Plinkett: It's because they got tracked to the salt planet.
["Is this all that's left?"]
Plinkett: It had to escape that. It had to escape there because the First Order was able to run a decloaking scan for their escape crafts, which was their big fucking plan. They had a cloaking ability for their crash, but they didn't use it earlier in the film.
["We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough 30 resistance transporters just launched from the cruiser."]
Plinkett: The First Order ran this decloaking scan because Benicio Del Toro told them to. Because he sold out Finn and Rose. Finn and Rose trusted Benicio because he seemed like he knew what he was doing, because he broke out of jail. Why not trust him? They had to use them, and not the real codebreaker, because this asshole called the cops on them, which led them to jail. And this asshole called the cops on them because they illegally parked their ship on the beach. It seemed like a dumb thing to do. They went to the casino planet in the first place because they had to go rogue.
["Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan."]
Plinkett: So they asked Maz Kanata for help, somebody they barely knew. They just met for five minutes in the last movie. They had to go on the secret mission to break the First Order's lightspeed tracker, because Holdo wouldn't tell Poe her plan. And Holdo wouldn't tell Poe her plan because she hates men.
["You have bet the survival of the resistance on bad odds and put us all at risk?"]
["Admiral, we're taking fire, do we turn around?"]
["No, you're too far out, full speed to planet--"]
Plinkettt: You bet on your own bad odds that the First Order didn't have a pair of these. We could trace the events back to the start almost. Why didn't she just tell them her plan? It kind of made sense. Except for the First Order could physically see the planet you were going to, and they were just going to follow you there anyway.
["Holdo knew the First Order was tracking our big ship. They're not monitoring for little transports."]
Plinkett: Um, why not?
["Slip down to the surface unnoticed, and hide till the First Order passes?"]
["Get all our forces down to that Resistance base. Let's finish this."]
["It could work."]
Plinkett: Why wouldn't they be monitoring for little transports? Also, how to Holdo know that? Just a good guess? Hey, there's no life signs on the big ship.
["It's empty."]
Plinkett: Maybe that cloaked all their escape crafts and went to that planet that's right fucking there. Maybe they weren't there! I'm no rocket scientist, but there's a planet there? And, and I think they all flew there.
["She was more interested in protecting the light than she was seeming like a hero."]
Plinkett: I guess all this crap was supposed to be about leadership or something. The moral or the lesson or whatever was that, in the Rebellion, your job was not to rebel. ["You're demoted."]
Plinkett: And to blindly follow your leaders. Kind of like the First Order.
["I just want to know what's going on."]
["Of course you do. I understand."]
Plinkett: Holdo had her plan, and she was in charge.
["And we need to shake them before we can find a new base, so what's our plan?"]
Plinkett: Don't you dare ask any questions, cuz he's got purple hair.
["So stick to your post and follow my orders."]
Plinkett: This is one area where this shit ain't like Star Trek at all. If Picard was in a situation where he didn't know what the fuck to do, he would ask everybody for their opinions. He would say, "What do you suggest?" Everyone would offer up ideas from each character's own unique perspective.
["Comments?"]
["I recommend that I return to the cruiser with an away team."
["A plasma shock. It would be painful, but it wouldn't cause any physical harm."]
["An interesting suggestion, Lieutenant."]
["What if they're trying to undermine our history for some reason?"]
["Some kind of guerrilla war?"]
["The Enterprise C would be outmanned and outgunned."]
["Unless we were to rearm them with modern--"]
["We can't do that. If we send that ship back with new technology, we'll be altering the past."]
["I agree, we're at war."]
["There's been no formal declaration of war."]
["Not from us, but certainly from them."]
["Perhaps we should reverse course."]
["For all we know, reversing course may be what leads us into the crash."]
["All right, Mr. La Forge."]
["I don't agree."]
["A concussive blast will blow out the security fields. We can go in with phasers in a wide beam, stun everybody, sort it out later."]
["So stick to your post, and follow my orders."]
["I have a problem with that kind of rigidity. It seems callous, and even a little cowardly."]
Plinkett: Now if I were on the cruiser in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I'd say, "Why don't we use cloaking technology on our escape crafts, secretly move everyone over to one of those other ships, and then lightspeed out of there?" If the tracker is just on Snoke's ship, split everyone up three ways, and take your chances. At least two-thirds of you will survive. That's about 266 people. Much better than the 12 you ended up with.
["Just give it to me one more time. Simpler."]
["So the First Order is only tracking us from one destroyer, the lead one."]
["So we blow that one up?"]
["But if we sneak aboard the lead destroyer and disable the tracker without them realizing--"]
["So we blow that one up?"]
["They won't realize it's off for one system cycle, about six minutes."]
["So we blow that one up?"]
["I like where your head's at, but no, they'd only start tracking us from another destroyer. But if we sneak onboard the lead destroyer--"]
["So we blow that one up?"]
["--disable the tracker without them realizing--"]
["They won't realize it's off for one system cycle, about six minutes."]
["Sneak onboard."]
["Just give it to me one more time. Simpler."]
["Disable the tracker, sneak onboard--"]
they won't realize it's off for one system cycle, about six minutes, sneak on

board. Just give it to me one more time, simply disable the tracker. Our food escapes me one more time. Sneak on board me destroy and delete one.

So flow that way they won't realize.

Or maybe keep popping back and forth at lightspeed with one of those small crafts, evacuate everyone somewhere safe, you know, just a little bit at a time back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. They don't seem to care. I literally have 10s of ideas. But this lady is technically in charge. So don't ask any questions. Or card was a smart man
agreed.

A comedy of errors is what they call it kids. A series of errors and mistakes though is not to be confused with a series of obstacles.

You can actually do this right? Yeah, about that.

When the Millennium Falcon encounters an asteroid belt, it's an obstacle. It's not because Han Solo is stupid. When Finn and Rose park their ship on a beach when there's probably some kind of spaceship parking lot that everyone uses. It's because they're stupid. When they decide to trust some guy who literally sounds like a snake. Remember kids, if he sounds like a snake, it's a mistake.

Hey Take it easy Vigo

Unknown Speaker :
sounds like snake. It's a mistake. Maybe. Also, if you're questioning my logic that the last Jedi was more structured as a comedy film just dip into the deleted scenes I'm not supposed to initiate contact with

officers but I'm here to take you for Captain material

Unknown Speaker :
take a look at all this fucking nonsense that was caught from the film not sure what my son was up to but I think he was trying to make a funny movie.

Unknown Speaker : 
Yeah

Unknown Speaker :
it's funny when Clark Griswold crashes the family truckster in that movie a series of bad decisions mistakes foolish errors make it a funny movie. It doesn't work in the Star Wars film it makes all your characters look dumb

why you ransacking your own ship

this is why this all seemed weird and bad when they're on a casino planet and roses complaining about like the industrial military complex of the universe or whatever

there's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich

selling weapons that

the First Order buys weapons from from crazy crazy looking characters in a casino she should have just said I hate this place but there's nothing we could do about it now we have a mission instead this happens
  
stop enjoying a stop enjoying

Unknown Speaker :
a casino and Star Wars you know with with fancy dress people it just seemed

Unknown Speaker :
and I expressed my fears to Ryan and

it was working to tear up that town make him hurt now it's worth it real

in a Star Wars film you need clear obstacles and drama

really, really strong.

Unknown Speaker :
The cannot keep information for no reason at all just to fulfill some kind of plot twist later. Twists and turns are one thing but confusing actions and motivations that are literally incomprehensible. That's not acceptable.

Once we're done the resistance will give you whatever you want.
 
Once you got the buzzer how much you got

Steady. Another thing people take issue with is the low speed chase. at all I'm okay with this. In a weird way, it kinda reminds me of Star Trek fuel status 15 times psi, approximately enough in one orbit. Star Trek often dealt with situations involving fuel and ships chasing and or tracking each other. power loss now at 12%. Captain redolent Star Wars was always more about the locations zipping around from one spot to the next without any mention of fuel or how long it would take to get there. That's where the Fantasy was. In Star Trek a light craft could take days or weeks or months to reach another star system. ETA 1330 hours sir. Not exactly warp speed. When he leaves off, Luke isn't going to sit in his X Wing for weeks until he gets the Daigo BA. An impulse we're not likely to be running into any planets are probably six or seven years. Oh crap. Patrick jump to hyperspace on my mom. See, though that was before they decided that x wings could fly at lightspeed which the showed Return of the Jedi because all the x wings and light crafts had the jump inside the big Mon Calamari cruiser before it jumped to lightspeed. So I don't know, is that a mistake and return the Jedi or right away the mere fact that a large chunk of the middle of the movie is just big spaceships kind of slowly chasing each other. That was different to say something positive, I would have been fine just cutting back and forth between just that situation and re doing things on Luke's planet. However, that's my next point that lends itself to my theory that the last Jedi is really a madcap comedy, people are always coming and going, which deflates the tension of the First Order having them trapped in a low speed chase. First off, Ryan brought himself into a hole when he realized that all of his characters were on the main ships being chased by the First Order a crappy thought. How can Finn and Rose gone a little adventure on some other planet when they're stuck on the fucking ship? Disney wants at least five locations and I've got to meet that quota. So I'm fitting row sneak out of the side of the Mon Calamari cruiser and some kind of smaller ship and leave ship. Why doesn't everyone do that than one the rebels leaving the escape ships, which for no reason at all can't go lightspeed. If this little shitty crappy ship has Lightspeed than you'd think emergency evacuation crafts would do. And they suddenly have some kind of cloaking ability, not like clicking on cloaking ability, but sensor cloaking ability, but like the First Order has windows all you need is a good old pair of these to see them if the fucking Hubble telescope could see Mars with this clarity from Earth. Your think the first order would have some kind of device that could zoom in like 100 feet and see all the escape crafts leaving Jesus Christ even pirates late 1800s had Looking Glasses send out the TIE Fighter send out the Thai fighters all these rebellion escape transports have no weapons and can go lightspeed. It's like shooting people in a barrel I mean fish anyway, so then after leaving canto bite rose fin and bunnies to steal some rich guys ship and then had to sneak ship they slipped through the detection grid with magical codes. Ray's also got business on Snoke ship so she goes there to using the Falcons little escape pod

Unknown Speaker :  
Number five, point A to point B. maintain our current course.

Unknown Speaker :
after her and Carlo fight the bad guys after smoke gets cut in half. Ray I guess then steel snakes personal ship, she took snakes escaped craft, only then to somehow end up back on the Falcon. What happened to Snoke ship? And Why wasn't she flying that thing into battle? I'm sure the ship of the Supreme Leader of the First Order has got to have some kind of mega firepower and shields on it right? Why don't you leave it parked somewhere in the salt. And then get on board the old rust bucket that's piloted by an ape that's infested with Furbies fly snaps first of all ship around and blow shit up this smells of the old are crap. How do I get right down to the salt planet now? Well, how about a throwaway line about how she stole snuck ship? She took Snopes escape craft, and then we'll just never talk about it again. By the way. The salt planet is a favorite vacation spot. This creature thought I'd squeezer the Star Trek reference. I hope you enjoyed it. Oh wait, here's something 100 rows Finn and the code breaker guy planned to get off of Snoke ship once they smashed up the tracking device. Good time to figure out how to get back to the fleet. I know the nurse escape Hotstar Chris he wasn't the first order know that escape pods were launched like shoot him down. You know Stormtroopers are like low level ranking military guys went AWOL. This wasn't a real good time to use one of those escape pod starcher thank Condor think of it with the first order even have escape pods, maybe for like the high ranking officers on the bridge. But shit how many people are on that ship stormtroopers and everyone in the first order is basically cannon fodder. The escape pod or lifeboat situation is probably worse than the Titanic was there all the way in the center of the fucking ship? It would take like 45 minutes for an escape pod to get out of that gigantic ship and Star Trek which is much more smarter. The

escape pods are always on the outside of the ship. I mean, the codebreaker guy, whether it was beneath CEO or the other guy, they were independent contractors not really part of the rebellion, so I doubt either of them would have been up for a suicide mission. I mean, rose and ven might have been, I mean, that ship was big, maybe go back to the little ship that they brought on board. But when somebody had found that ship, like a stormtrooper be like, Hey, what's that? And then they'd hit like the alarm button. I don't know I just don't make sense. It's just like they're doing things without thinking attempt to figure out how to get back to the plate and they're making one mistake after the other just like Clark Griswold but this chapter is called from point A to point B, meaning how do people get from here to there? It's either really stupid or not thought out at all or brushed over or happened so fast you don't even really notice it like my next point. This is the absolute worst thing that happens and no I'm not talking about the Oh shit. I totally forgot about where BB eight is. My guess he somehow got inside an ATS T which conveniently has a detachable top that falls off so that we could see him piloting it I guess yes, you could shoot out like a cannon even get up there. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about how Rosa and Finn get inside the Rebel base on the salt planet they conveniently steal some kind of first order ship after killing Captain plasma they fly it down to the salt planet real quick and fast and conveniently and with precision timing are able to fly it into the base stores before they close they're the only first order ship that makes it into the base before the doors close just thumb not anybody else. Jesus that's some fucking good odds. Maybe should go back to cantina Brighton put some miles on a slot machine. I don't even remember this happening the first time I watched the movie happened so fast. You don't even really have time to think about it. It's just like oh yeah, no Rosen Finnur inside the Rebel base, and it's a good thing to they didn't kill anybody. Look out look out Ron. Don't get smashed by the sliding spaceship it's another one of those How do I get my characters from here to there situation? Yeah, I'll just I'll just slap this together. No one will notice it'll happen so fast. Was this movie even thought out at all ahead of time? What a shit show. Speaking of a shit show. Let's take a look at this short film recently created by and starring Ryan Johnson or was made exclusively for the star wars.com website. Number six the other sea plot are gone as previously stated. I'm not here to take a huge dump on this movie. I have a toilet for that. Many have called The Last Jedi prequal bad

Unknown Speaker :
Jesus Christ how racist? Oh my god. Ryan Johnson played his hand in a poker game, but it wasn't that strong.

Unknown Speaker :
You have to lay down all your chips on it in front of a lot of really good poker players. and say this is the right decision based on nothing but this little tingle, you get in your stomach. And you know, that's scary. That's really terrifying. I would be worried if everybody across the board was like, yeah, it was a good movie. And then there are other people who walk out. Just I mean, literally saying that was the worst movie I've ever seen. Having those two extremes to me is, is the mark of the type of movie that I want to make.

Unknown Speaker  :
He didn't want to give the audience what it wanted, what it craved, and what a crave was the familiar, the heroic. Adventure here's kind of like a school teacher that was rewarding us with movie day.

Passive crates,

shot by shot. Any questions any answers greatly appreciate it. Page one. Instead of showing us something fun. He showed us something fun but educational too. That's not fun. The audience wanted Luke to come back out of hiding show that he was a true Jedi badass and help Ray stop Snoke and run maybe at least temporarily. Instead look wanted nothing to do with anything cheap. Like I said a rock and a hard place. The idea that Luke was on an island cut off from the forests and basically just wanting to die was one of the more interesting aspects of the movie. Ray wanted to help. Look finally agreed but then was like no. Did you

Unknown Speaker :
hear a word I just said seek what? I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole first order right now. I'd be like I take on the whole entire myself. I know what you mean.

Unknown Speaker : 
But then Ray finally just as Fuckit and leaves Good for her. She's intrigued by trying to save Kylo Ren was seems like he's kind of interested in helping her too. They got this weird connection. That's that's different. You got me movie. I'm interested now. Are you gonna do for me next? Are you gonna fuck me in the ass?

Unknown Speaker :
There? Watch your ass.

And you know what? Once Ray laughed, that should have been the last time we saw Luke, at least in this film. And here's how the film should have ended. Join me

Unknown Speaker :
there, you got a solid cliffhanger and a satisfactory ending? A big bad guy, his dad. His big bad ship is ripped apart in a self sacrifice by what should have been last? And most importantly, what will be the future of this new Kylo and Rey Alliance? Romance? A new chaotic neutral Jedi Sith breed so many new things so many new ideas. Oh, no that piece of junk. I guess he's still bad.
 
Time to little things die. The Jedi rebels let it all die.

He wants to tear down the first order and the resistance Okay, that's interesting.

The resistance isn't that might

Unknown Speaker : 
push through that he still goes after the resistance with the first order that he makes himself to new Supreme Leader. Then the movie ends with Luke coming back to save the day, but he really doesn't he stalls so that everyone can escape

Unknown Speaker :
Skywalkers doing this so we can survive,

which only serves to make Kylo Ren more angry and more embarrassed. First, it gets beat by a girl who has never used a lightsaber before, of which Snoke personally tried some on

you on balanced, bested by a girl who had never held a lightsaber filed

Unknown Speaker  :
and he gets beat by an elderly hologram. All those people saw him fighting with an astral projection. Whatever. You think you'd have the force sense to tell that that was just like a fake thing? And I could like read someone's feelings when you're a Jedi or

Unknown Speaker :  
prisons I'm not felt.
 
You could sense things. He would be like sensing nothing right if he had any kind of skills. God how embarrassing and I thought getting kicked out of the portly gentleman was embarrassing. I kept splitting too many pants in the dressing room. Oh no Ray learns that LinkedIn nobody was talking about at all. It's not about lifting rocks. Because the force literally is about moving rocks.

Also this random little boy has Jedi powers. So it is some kind of inherited ability, or else all kids would be able to use the force right there God was everything you said wrong.

Unknown Speaker  :
The force is not a power you have. And

Unknown Speaker :
beyond that, something truly special potential of your blood life.

Unknown Speaker  :
Go drink some more monster Ted milk you weird hobo Donald. We're right back where we started, the resistance is on the run on the first order is still chasing after them. No real big revelations, just the death of two major characters that represented the quote old ways

Unknown Speaker : 
of the old films. It's time to little things die, the supreme

Unknown Speaker :
Sith Lord and the Jedi Master. What we're left with is a sort of Sith in charge of the first order. And a girl who has a whole bunch of misinformation Luke wanted the Jedi to die.

Unknown Speaker : 
Time for the Jedi to end

Unknown Speaker :
But boy oh boy, look how it helped out your friends. Those Jedi books are worthless. Even Yoda said books

Unknown Speaker : 
the sacred Jedi tax

Unknown Speaker :
when didn't have you? Well, ah Turner's

Unknown Speaker :
tried to burn them down with lightning. But then she took the books, I guess to study them further. So they have value did she take the book so that she could teach others? That's not what Luke wanted? Who the fuck knows what's going on are black and white good versus evil space saga is now a muddled ambiguous gray. All those wonderful moments in the original films are filled with excitement, thrills, chills, action and adventure, love and romance, and heartfelt emotion. For some reason all rang hollow in this movie, they felt forced or rehashed or lacked real emotion. And the parts that did stick with you stuck with you for the wrong reasons. They made you feel sick, confused, awkward, uncomfortable, strange, embarrassed, disgusted, and annoyed. The only part that had any emotional weight to it was when Luke was saying goodbye to Leila. And really, that was just because it was those two characters that you liked. And what happened shortly thereafter with Carrie Fisher in real life. Spoilers, she died. Number seven. Little details make a big picture. Finally, to end on a good note, I'd like to point out some of the great little details in the movie,

Unknown Speaker  :
it's empty. They're just trying to fill our attention away, because

Unknown Speaker : 
it's not all bad kids. I really liked how low tech the First Orders monitors were in keeping with Star Wars tradition, they were a blocky old looking technology. I was very happy with that. It's an eight one during Kylo and Ray's conversations. Kyle gets a little water on his hands, you know, because Ray's out by the water. So nice little foreshadowing to what happens with Luke later on. I really like this moment to

Unknown Speaker :
our distress signal has been received at multiple points. But no response.

Unknown Speaker : 
It's like we got it when Billy Lord said it.

Unknown Speaker :  
They've heard us but no one's coming.

Unknown Speaker  :
But then this lady said it again. Just slower and Dumber, so that we doubly understood. I'm so dumb. I also like this detail too. When after the most epic and amazing thing ever to happen in the history of Star Wars happens. These background extras are just chatting about something. Should in everyone's eyes be fucking glued to the windows. Oh my god. Did you see what the fuck just happened? How's the weather? You catch the game last week? Terry, do you remember when Finn had a terrible concussion and was suffering from dementia? And he thought his little rusty piece of crap ship would stop a super laser that wouldn't just get incinerated or shut down by a million laser blasts before it even got close. How silly. What a fun moment. You got to get your head checked out Finn, because you're dumber than Clark Griswold. Hey, then remember when Rose crashed her little piece of crap ship right into fins, risking both horrible back injuries and death in order to stop him from crashing into the super laser. That was pretty fucking risky. And it's like love is the only way and she kisses him and he's like, what? I don't like you at all. Rio and then in the background the rebellion dies off hysterically terrible. I mean, great. Also, do you remember the fight scene after Snoke was dead when his guards pointlessly fought ran Kylo if I were one of those guards I wonder just ran away. Because clearly they're totally enough to kind of just stand there waiting awkwardly for one guard to finish attacking before they attack. Hey, yo, where are you going? What are you doing? Hey, wait You Why did you run over there? And what the heck is this guy waiting for? Can they even see what they're doing in those helmets? Hey, why did you go over there? Do you remember when Luke said the force is not a power that you have a shirt is just look at Leah. She didn't do shit to develop her power. It was just inherited.

Unknown Speaker :
You have that power to time. You'll learn to use it as

Unknown Speaker : 
she's always sitting down. But yet she could survive the cold vacuum of space an admiral Akhbar and nobody else can? Sure does seem like some kind of inherited Jedi power that she has that piece of junk Are you remember what Kylo Ren was so mad at the Millennium Falcon that he ordered all their Thai fighters to attack it? You know, so that they could leave all the ships trying to attack their super laser free to attack they're super laser. She Alright, so you know Ray was on board the Millennium Falcon. Or was he calling the ship but she may not look like much but she's got it where it counts, kid. Oh, geez. I wasn't expecting such outdated and sexist sailor talk from such a progressive film. How dare they? I'm protesting. C'mon, Antifa let's get Star Wars next. Number eight, the circle of confusion is complete. To get what I was doing. I was doing a whole bunch of things. If you thought the opening of The Last Jedi was odd and messed with your brain, let's talk about the tone and visuals and general attitude of the ending. Now I know Ryan didn't want us film compared to empire. But we really need to do that here. First of all, Luke starts off as he did at the end of a new hope. I nobody read me happy plucky, idealistic. That is no monster Moses face and tries to eat him alive. And he's like, Oh my God, this fucking galaxy is a nightmare. Those traumatic then Yoda lays out some real scary shit to him.

Unknown Speaker : 
I'm not afraid you will be. You will

Unknown Speaker :
be done. He has visions of his friends dying. That cuts off a ghost of Darth Vader and sees his fucking face inside of the decapitated head. He's unable to rescue his friends. He gets his fucking hand chopped off and is told the most evil man in the galaxy is his father. I am overall a pretty shitty reality hitting day. Now stick with me. In this film Ray is off to meet the legend Luke Skywalker.

Unknown Speaker :
Force a Jedi all Tatro

Unknown Speaker :
Well turns out to be a big homeless asshole who's fucking rude to her. It tells her that the Jedi are shitty and a bunch of failures, leaving her with absolutely no hope in him. Only with Kylo Ren and even though he kills Snoke to save her, he still wants to murder all of her friends blah. She's literally witnessed to the deaths of mostly all of the rebellion at this point. Like from her perspective, she went off to get Luke to help everybody and she totally failed them

Unknown Speaker :
here's where Luke is at the same story moment in Empire. Here's where Ray is

Unknown Speaker :  
she likes that so that an empire the rebellion fleet is limping along at a slow pace. Or another visual similarity could be like a beat army heading back to its base and defeat. The music is mostly somber. Our characters are licking their wounds so to speak to music is still slightly hopeful, but with a twinge of melancholy. Just perfect and The Last Jedi. The Millennium Falcon is speeding ahead at lightspeed which visually indicates adventure and action and Fun. The fun begins on board. It's a fun reunion or something people seem to be in generally good spirits even though 46,000 rebels died leaving only 12 People left alive as hugging and handshaking. And all the shots are very reminiscent of the ending of Return of the Jedi, where of course the Empire was totally defeated. So you're like, everything that just happened was really bad. There should be a fucking funeral dirge playing. Everyone should be shell shocked. And sitting there in silence was the Millennium Falcon limps along at five miles an hour spewing black smoke out of the back bar. This is Disney and Mr. Not what you'd expect. I don't

Unknown Speaker :
want to freak anybody out here. But I think we just made a Star Wars movie.

Unknown Speaker :
So you're literally left scratching your head and confusion as to how to feel. Should I be happy now? Why is everyone happy? Everything. Our gun might not have noticed it. But your brain did. One thing that should be noted here, it seems like Ryan Johnson is a pretty good guy. Everyone had nothing but nice things to say about him.

Unknown Speaker :
And Ryan, not once did he show any type of anger? Or could it be not once was he? Was he rude? Or was he did he let the pressure of all of this gets him and his pressure?

Unknown Speaker : 
Well, almost everyone. He's I think she was joking. But I'm not sure I know. This guy really didn't like him. But that's another story.

Unknown Speaker :
No matter how this comes out.

Unknown Speaker :
If I'm wonderful. It's because of him. And if it's terrible,

Unknown Speaker : 
it's also he's fun. He seems like a pretty nice guy. He likes to laugh. And maybe it was just a little bit nervous to be working on such a big production shed I would be. He also just wanted to write a good script and make a movie that was unexpected. Maybe a little refreshing, a different take on Star Wars. And for that I give him respect. Don't mess it up. The problem was that he failed spectacularly at it on every level

Unknown Speaker : 
then it was just a matter of really being honest with myself like is that what's best for this trilogy? Is that what should happen here and just questioning that over and over again.

Unknown Speaker : 
So you know what kids, number nine. And Mike just sit out Michelson in the park and feed the birds. watch the sunset. walk on the beach. Listen to the waves crashing the shore. FUCK DO anything in the world for two hours and watch the next one. And while I would never suggest a boycott boy, I do love cots.
