MIKE:
Oh.
Hello.
I didn't see you there.
Hi, my name is Mike Stoklasa.
And in 2012, Red Letter Media began a collaboration with Exhibit A Pictures, the company behind The People vs. George Lucas, as well as their newest film, 78/52.
The purpose of this collaboration was to create a mini Mr. Plinkett review for use in their film, Doc of the Dead.
The pop culture zombie documentary was released by Epix.
But sadly, except for a few shots, none of the Mr. Plinkett review segments were included in the final cut of the film.
Now, thanks to Exhibit A Pictures and Epix, we present to you the never before seen Mr. Plinkett zombie video.
Enjoy.
And have a happy and safe Halloween.

PLINKETT:
What a perfectly average morning.
Nothing unusual about today.
Which makes it the perfect day for a zombie apocalypse to not happen.
La-dee-da-dee-doo...
It's a beautiful morning.
Mm, I smell breakfast.
Oh, what's this on the news?

NEWS ANCHOR:
As an unknown viral infection rages out of control.
The cause of the virus is yet unknown.
But it has been reported that the dead are coming back to life.

PLINKETT:
Oh, my god.

NEWS ANCHOR:
The President is declaring martial law.
The state of New York...

PLINKETT:
Oh, my god.
This is crazy.
Oh, my god!
What the hell was that?

BEATRICE:
Oh, that must be little Betty.
Harry, would you like to go and get your granddaughter?

PLINKETT:
What?
Our granddaughter?

BEATRICE:
You remember.
She's staying with us while her mom's in the hospital with that terrible infected bite wound.

PLINKETT:
What?
Oh, right.
Yeah.
I'll go get her.
Betty?
Is that you?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Betty?
Betty, why are you just standing there?
Is that blood all over your jammie-jams?
Why are you just standing there?
And more importantly, why are you so dramatically backlit?
Why is your hair in front of your face?
Hey, Beatrice?
Is Betty one of those deaf kids?

BEATRICE:
No, I don't think so.

PLINKETT:
Hello?
Why is there a smoke machine running in the hallway now?
Did you turn that on, Betty?
Betty, did you set up dramatic horror movie lighting?
Oh, well.
Even though I've seen this scene a million times in every movie, I'm just going to start slowly walking towardss you with my arms oustretched, asking if everything's okay, even though this looks highly suspicious, and at any moment, you're gonna...
Oh, my god!
Damn zombies.
These nails cost me $2.49 a box.
It's a good thing I had all this scrap wood, though.
Well, that's that.
I wonder if these zombies are gonna be the fast ones or the slow ones.
I hope they're the slow ones, because I'm an old man.
Oh, there's one now.
Oh, great.
They're the fast zombies.
That's no good for me.
Oh.
Wait a minute.
It's just a jogger.
Whew.
Well, that's good.
But that still doesn't answer my question whether or not the zombies are fast ones.
Oh.
I guess they're slow ones.
Well, that's good news for me that they're slow ones.
I guess that guy's in shape.
He'll be fine.
But, wait.
If you can just run away from slow zombies with ease, then why aren't all new zombies old people like me?
In fact, how does a slow zombie outbreak even get out of control in the first place?
Now I could maybe see a slow zombie outbreak get out of control in a densely occupied apartment building.
But way out in the country, where there's just so much distance between the infected and the living...
Well, not so much.
Just look out my window now.
There's a whole bunch of zombies milling about.
I don't recognize any of these people.
They must have walked here all the way from New Jersey.
At that speed, it would've taken months.
Maybe even years!
Why not just go to a crowded night club?
Go in there and pretend like you're dancing, but at the same time swinging your arms around, trying to grab onto somebody to eat them.
Why the fuck are you all hanging outside of my farmhouse?
So how did all this shit start, anyways?
Usually, it starts with just one zombie.
It's some guy in a hospital who says he's sick, your fucking spouse, your stupid annoying granddaughter, and so on.
Then a few people will get bit trying to help their friend or loved one who has just turned into something that looks like a living Christopher Walken.
But then, just as everyone realizes what's going on, the problem could easily be solved with some guns.
What problem can't be solved with guns?
Or you could solve this problem with a bunch of handcuffs.
Or a pizza cutter.
Or one of those lighter things.
Or a flyswatter.
You know, I once killed a man with a flyswatter.
Or was that a fly?
Also, the rate at which one becomes a zombie isn't based on height, weight, age, or sex.
It's based on your importance of character.
I wonder how long it'll be for me.
I got by my stupid wife.
Oh, my god.
This looks nasty.
I should pour some hydrogen peroxide on it.
My wife turned in, like, an hour so after my granddaughter bit her.
Just enough time for me to tie her up.
It's also a good thing I had that hatchet.
Chopped my granddaughter's head off.
I almost did that once, even before I knew she was a zombie.
But, you know, I've been sitting here for over two hours now.
When will I become a zombie?
Most modern zombie movies seem to be about diseases now.
But in that old black and white movie, it was radiation from space that caused the recently-deceased to come back to life.
So by recently-deceased, they mean...
Number 1. No Skeletons.
Because skeletons don't have flesh or muscle to move around them old bones.
Sorry, Bea Arthur.
You won't be doing the Golden Girls reunion anytime soon.
Stay in your grave, you old cunt!
You lied to me!
Number 2. Not the Recently Buried.
You expect a zombie with limited strength and mobility to get out of a coffin under six feet of dirt?
Especially if they're elderly people?
Shit.
I can't even get out of my chair.
Number 3. People in Morgues.
So we're left with the recently-deceased being people that have just died, right?
Like, by running with scissors, suicide. hit by a school bus, cancer, choking on a hot dog, choking on a cancer dog, fire, choking while on fire, auto-erotic asphyxiation, and falling from a tree stand.
Anyway.
So if you died of natural causes, you'd just be laying on a table somewhere, waiting for a mortician to dress you up all fancy like.
And then -- BAMM! -- you'd wake up, and you'd be free to move about and bite people.
Oh, my god.
Are you...
Oh, my god!
Help!
Help!
Aughhh!
Oh, my god!
So why are the majority of initial zombies either young people or little girls?
Romero zombies were not just the undead, though.
They were also cannibals.
They had a taste for human flesh.
Right now, as I speak, hundreds and hundres of zombies wanna get into my house.
And it's not to eat my wife's pot roast.
It's to eat me!
But I'm nothing but an elderly bag of bones.
Why do they want me so bad?
I have no muscle or nutrients of any kind.
Plus, I'm filled with urine.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my god!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my god!
Oh!
I drank too much prune juice!
Oh!
Oh!
Fucking!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh...
Also, zombies don't always just want brains.
They'll eat whatever's available to them.
Romero zombies never wanted brains.
That was first mentioned in the 1980's movie, The Return of the Living Dead.

ERNIE:
Why do you eat people?

ZOMBIE:
Not people.
Brains!

ERNIE:
Brains only?

ZOMBIE:
Yes.

PLINKETT:
I doubt a zombie would haved the strength to crack open a skull.
Anyway.
We all know how a zombie kills us.
But how do we kill a zombie?
So does a zombie need to be shot in the head?
Or does general dismemberment do the trick?
Well, let's find out.
I've got my pistol right here.
I tied up my wife in a chair, because she's a zombie.
Wait, wait.
No.
I guess she's still a zombie.
Well, I'll try another shot here.
But it seems like she's still alive.
Let me try another one.
Well, it seems that three shots in the gut hasn't stopped her.
I guess it's time for the headshot.
Let me take aim.
Goodbye, honeypie.
Huh.
So I guess these zombies adhere to Romero's Law, meaning a shot to the brain kills them.
Wait.
What's that on the TV?
Something's actually coming on.

NEWS ANCHOR:
We just got word.
We're getting a live feed from the White House.
In a moment, the President will address the nation on this growing zombie crisis.

PLINKETT:
Oh, my god.
The President's gonna speak.
I hope he has a plan for getting us out of this mess.
And also a plan to deal with the zombies.

NEWS ANCHOR:
And more importantly, leadership.
And now, we go live to the White House.

PRESIDENT:
Ughhh!

PLINKETT:
Uh-huh.

PRESIDENT:
Ugh.

PLINKETT:
Wait.
What's the problem?
What's wrong with him?
Oh!
He's a zombie!
Ow!
Damn you, zombies!
What do you want from me?
Get away from my house!
Take that!
I'll shoot you right between the eyes, you fuckers!
Get away from my windows!
You bastards!

NEWS ANCHOR:
Chaos is continuing in Los Angeles...
After the zombie outbreak.
There's no longer an outbreak, but a full-on pandemic.

PLINKETT:
So why are the news reporters always the last ones doing their jobs during a zombie apocalypse?
Do they even make that much money?
Why are they so committed over all other professional services?

NEWS ANCHOR:
The U.S. military personnel still attempting to isolate the zombie outbreak.
We will continue to report to you what's happening, as long as we can continue to report live.
Although our truck is heavily damaged, and I've been getting very little sleep.
I'm starting to hallucinate...

PLINKETT:
Anyway.
Fuck that.
Look how dangerous that shit it.
If I were this lady, I would've fled a long time ago.

NEWS ANCHOR:
Run!

PLINKETT:
Gosh.
Would you look at...
Hey!
Where'd the picture go?
Get back to work, you cowards!
Wait.
Oh, no.
The damn zombies are going nuts now.
Hey!
Get away from my windows!
It took my minutes to nail those boards up.
I guess this ends one of two ways.
Me shooting myself, or zombies eating me.
Neither are good endings, I suppose.
You know, I don't think this zombie outbreak will last all that long.
Here's why.
Number 1. Zombies Probably Can't Digest Food.
While they are filled with an uneding lust for human guts, the zombie's digesting system is probably not functioning.
So eventually their stomachs will be full.
They can no longer fit any more matter into them.
If they have an appetite to begin with, then it's safe to say at some point that appetite would subside.
Number 2. Safety in Numbers.
As zombies cluster in packs, they tend to eat in packs.
This pattern would prevent future zombies from being created.
With the now-rare situation of a lone human getting bit by a lone zombie, human survivors and zombie hordes now cluster together.
If one human encountered six zombies, the six zombies would eat the human down to nothing.
Now if six humans encountered one zombie, that zombie would get his ass kicked.
But this is all theoretical.
The reality of this shit is right outside my front door.
And right here on my arm.
I still haven't turned.
Maybe it's because I'm filled with so many prescription medications, that I've neutralized the disease.
Well, I guess this is the end.
The zombies are almost inside my house.
It's the end for old Mr. Plinkett.
I guess I'll fucking kill myself now.
I left one bullet for me, just in case.
Because I ain't gonna let these zombie bastards eat me.
All right.
Now it's time to shoot myself in the brain.
Ow!
Ugh!
Oh, no!
I'm still alive!
The bullet must've just grazed my brain.
Oh!
How could I have fucked that up?
Oh, no.
Here comes the zombies!
Oh, fuck!
Ow!
Ow, my guts!
Help me, baby Jesus!
Help me!
Oh, my god!
Get away!
Get away!
Get away!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Ow!
Ow!
I'll be back!
I'll be back!
