Where is the Episode III review?
Stop shouting at me.
I'm working on it.
I'm almost done.
Why haven't you finished it yet?
What is wrong with you?
Quit shouting and yelling at me.
We want it now!
What's wrong with your face?
What's wrong with my face?
What's wrong with your face?
Look, I'll have the review done by the end of the year, okay?
Probably.
Maybe.
It's almost done.
I am not falling for that bullshit.
Do you mean this year or next year?
Since it's Christmas, I thought I'd share some letter with you, written to me by some of the good children of the internet.
Johnny in Sarasota, Florida, writes, "Hey, where's the Episode III review, you fat fuck?"
Sally in Rockford, Illinois, writes:
"I'm not getting what I want."
"Thanks for ruining Christmas, you bastard."
"Plinkett equals the Grinch."
And lastly, Tommy from Riverside, California, writes:
"No one cares about your stupid movie."
"All we want is the review, you fucker."
"Your fifteen minutes will be up soon, you fucking asshole."
"And I'll be laughing at you stupid asshole faggots."
Good.
I can feel their hate.
Look, can we just set the hatred aside for just one day this year?
As hard as it is for me, I'm gonna say it:
"Merry Christmas, Palpy."
Oh.
Um.
Well, um...
Fuck you!
