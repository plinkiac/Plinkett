Hey, everyone.
It's me, Mr. Plinkett.
And I'm here to tell you that Red Letter Media has got something new for you.
It's a Patreon account.
Or page.
Something like that.
What is a Patreon, you ask?
I don't know.
Somebody tell me.
Hello?
Uh-huh.
Oh it's over 
oh really 
you've got to be kidding me
so on this part room you can choose
choose to donate to help brother loves a
movie and make their stuff you know make
it better make it faster especially my
reviews I'm working on one right now and
it's taking forever a $2.00 a month
pledge will get you access to private
posts by the media gang including
updates on what they're working on
comments on current movies and whatever
else they feel like posted $5 will get
to whatever 2 bucks gets you plus
behind-the-scenes photos and graphics
and stuff like that and for 15 a month
you get exclusive never-before-seen
video content behind the scenes
leftovers outtakes weird stuff like that
mr. blanket smells like a soiled
mattress that's been soiled on by
another mattress it's like a
subscription that's voluntary you know
